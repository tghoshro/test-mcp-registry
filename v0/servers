If you are the maintainer of a plugin, or custom DocumentConverter, you likely need to update your code. Otherwise, if only using the MarkItDown class or CLI (as in these examples), you should not need to change anything.\n\nMarkItDown is a lightweight Python utility for converting various files to Markdown for use with LLMs and related text analysis pipelines. To this end, it is most comparable to [textract](https://github.com/deanmalmgren/textract), but with a focus on preserving important document structure and content as Markdown (including: headings, lists, tables, links, etc.) While the output is often reasonably presentable and human-friendly, it is meant to be consumed by text analysis tools -- and may not be the best option for high-fidelity document conversions for human consumption.\n\nMarkItDown currently supports the conversion from:\n\n- PDF\n- PowerPoint\n- Word\n- Excel\n- Images (EXIF metadata and OCR)\n- Audio (EXIF metadata and speech transcription)\n- HTML\n- Text-based formats (CSV, JSON, XML)\n- ZIP files (iterates over contents)\n- Youtube URLs\n- EPubs\n- ... and more!\n\n## Why Markdown?\n\nMarkdown is extremely close to plain text, with minimal markup or formatting, but still\nprovides a way to represent important document structure. Mainstream LLMs, such as\nOpenAI's GPT-4o, natively \"_speak_\" Markdown, and often incorporate Markdown into their\nresponses unprompted. This suggests that they have been trained on vast amounts of\nMarkdown-formatted text, and understand it well. As a side benefit, Markdown conventions\nare also highly token-efficient.\n\n## Prerequisites\nMarkItDown requires Python 3.10 or higher. It is recommended to use a virtual environment to avoid dependency conflicts.\n\nWith the standard Python installation, you can create and activate a virtual environment using the following commands:\n\n```bash\npython -m venv .venv\nsource .venv/bin/activate\n```\n\nIf using `uv`, you can create a virtual environment with:\n\n```bash\nuv venv --python=3.12 .venv\nsource .venv/bin/activate\n# NOTE: Be sure to use 'uv pip install' rather than just 'pip install' to install packages in this virtual environment\n```\n\nIf you are using Anaconda, you can create a virtual environment with:\n\n```bash\nconda create -n markitdown python=3.12\nconda activate markitdown\n```\n\n## Installation\n\nTo install MarkItDown, use pip: `pip install 'markitdown[all]'`. Alternatively, you can install it from the source:\n\n```bash\ngit clone git@github.com:microsoft/markitdown.git\ncd markitdown\npip install -e 'packages/markitdown[all]'\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n### Command-Line\n\n```bash\nmarkitdown path-to-file.pdf > document.md\n```\n\nOr use `-o` to specify the output file:\n\n```bash\nmarkitdown path-to-file.pdf -o document.md\n```\n\nYou can also pipe content:\n\n```bash\ncat path-to-file.pdf | markitdown\n```\n\n### Optional Dependencies\nMarkItDown has optional dependencies for activating various file formats. Earlier in this document, we installed all optional dependencies with the `[all]` option. However, you can also install them individually for more control. For example:\n\n```bash\npip install 'markitdown[pdf, docx, pptx]'\n```\n\nwill install only the dependencies for PDF, DOCX, and PPTX files.\n\nAt the moment, the following optional dependencies are available:\n\n* `[all]` Installs all optional dependencies\n* `[pptx]` Installs dependencies for PowerPoint files\n* `[docx]` Installs dependencies for Word files\n* `[xlsx]` Installs dependencies for Excel files\n* `[xls]` Installs dependencies for older Excel files\n* `[pdf]` Installs dependencies for PDF files\n* `[outlook]` Installs dependencies for Outlook messages\n* `[az-doc-intel]` Installs dependencies for Azure Document Intelligence\n* `[audio-transcription]` Installs dependencies for audio transcription of wav and mp3 files\n* `[youtube-transcription]` Installs dependencies for fetching YouTube video transcription\n\n### Plugins\n\nMarkItDown also supports 3rd-party plugins. Plugins are disabled by default. To list installed plugins:\n\n```bash\nmarkitdown --list-plugins\n```\n\nTo enable plugins use:\n\n```bash\nmarkitdown --use-plugins path-to-file.pdf\n```\n\nTo find available plugins, search GitHub for the hashtag `#markitdown-plugin`. To develop a plugin, see `packages/markitdown-sample-plugin`.\n\n### Azure Document Intelligence\n\nTo use Microsoft Document Intelligence for conversion:\n\n```bash\nmarkitdown path-to-file.pdf -o document.md -d -e \"<document_intelligence_endpoint>\"\n```\n\nMore information about how to set up an Azure Document Intelligence Resource can be found [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/document-intelligence/how-to-guides/create-document-intelligence-resource?view=doc-intel-4.0.0)\n\n### Python API\n\nBasic usage in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom markitdown import MarkItDown\n\nmd = MarkItDown(enable_plugins=False) # Set to True to enable plugins\nresult = md.convert(\"test.xlsx\")\nprint(result.text_content)\n```\n\nDocument Intelligence conversion in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom markitdown import MarkItDown\n\nmd = MarkItDown(docintel_endpoint=\"<document_intelligence_endpoint>\")\nresult = md.convert(\"test.pdf\")\nprint(result.text_content)\n```\n\nTo use Large Language Models for image descriptions (currently only for pptx and image files), provide `llm_client` and `llm_model`:\n\n```python\nfrom markitdown import MarkItDown\nfrom openai import OpenAI\n\nclient = OpenAI()\nmd = MarkItDown(llm_client=client, llm_model=\"gpt-4o\", llm_prompt=\"optional custom prompt\")\nresult = md.convert(\"example.jpg\")\nprint(result.text_content)\n```\n\n### Docker\n\n```sh\ndocker build -t markitdown:latest .\ndocker run --rm -i markitdown:latest < ~/your-file.pdf > output.md\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nThis project welcomes contributions and suggestions.

When presented via the `Authorization: Bearer` header, this key unlocks access to sensitive data and protected functions (like `systemd-journal`, `windows-events` and `processes`). This temporary API key mechanism will eventually be replaced with a new authentication system integrated with Netdata Cloud.\n\nAI assistants have different visibility depending on where they connect:\n\n- **Netdata Cloud**: (coming soon) Full visibility across all nodes in your infrastructure\n- **Netdata Parent Node**: Visibility across all child nodes connected to that parent\n- **Netdata Child/Standalone Node**: Visibility only into that specific node\n\n## Transport Options\n\nNetdata implements the MCP protocol with multiple transport options:\n\n| Transport           | Endpoint                   | Use Case                                                     | Version Requirement  |\n|---------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|\n| **WebSocket**       | `ws://YOUR_IP:19999/mcp`   | Original transport, requires nd-mcp bridge for stdio clients | v2.6.0+              |\n| **HTTP Streamable** | `http://YOUR_IP:19999/mcp` | Direct connection from AI clients supporting HTTP            | v2.7.2+              |\n| **SSE**             | `http://YOUR_IP:19999/sse` | Server-Sent Events for real-time streaming                   | v2.7.2+              |\n\n- **Direct Connection** (v2.7.2+): AI clients that support HTTP or SSE transports can connect directly to Netdata\n- **Bridge Required**: AI clients that only support stdio need the `nd-mcp` (stdio-to-websocket) or `mcp-remote` (stdio-to-http or stdio-to-sse) bridge\n\n### Official MCP Remote Client (mcp-remote)\n\nIf your AI client doesn't support HTTP/SSE directly and you don't want to use `nd-mcp`, you can use the official MCP remote client (requires Netdata v2.7.2+):\n\n```bash\n# Export your MCP key once per shell\nexport NETDATA_MCP_API_KEY=\"$(cat /var/lib/netdata/mcp_dev_preview_api_key)\"\n\n# For HTTP transport\nnpx mcp-remote@latest --http http://YOUR_NETDATA_IP:19999/mcp \\\n  --allow-http \\\n  --header \"Authorization: Bearer $NETDATA_MCP_API_KEY\"\n\n# For SSE transport\nnpx mcp-remote@latest --sse http://YOUR_NETDATA_IP:19999/mcp \\\n  --allow-http \\\n  --header \"Authorization: Bearer $NETDATA_MCP_API_KEY\"\n```\n\n**Note:** The `--allow-http` flag is required for non-HTTPS connections. Only use this on trusted networks as traffic will not be encrypted.\n\n## Finding the nd-mcp Bridge\n\n> **Note**: With the new HTTP and SSE transports, many AI clients can now connect directly to Netdata without nd-mcp. Check your AI client's documentation to see if it supports direct HTTP or SSE connections.\n\nThe nd-mcp bridge is only needed for AI clients that:\n- Only support `stdio` communication (like some desktop applications)\n- Cannot use HTTP or SSE transports directly\n- Cannot use `npx mcp-remote@latest`\n\nThe `nd-mcp` bridge needs to be available on your desktop or laptop where your AI client runs. Since most users run Netdata on remote servers rather than their local machines, you have two options:\n\n1. **If you have Netdata installed locally** - Use the existing nd-mcp\n2. **If Netdata is only on remote servers** - Build nd-mcp on your desktop/laptop\n\n### Option 1: Using Existing nd-mcp\n\nIf you have Netdata installed on your desktop/laptop, find the existing bridge:\n\n#### Linux\n\n```bash\n# Try these locations in order:\nwhich nd-mcp\nls -la /usr/sbin/nd-mcp\nls -la /usr/bin/nd-mcp\nls -la /opt/netdata/usr/bin/nd-mcp\nls -la /usr/local/bin/nd-mcp\nls -la /usr/local/netdata/usr/bin/nd-mcp\n\n# Or search for it:\nfind / -name \"nd-mcp\" 2>/dev/null\n```\n\nCommon locations:\n\n- **Native packages (apt, yum, etc.)**: `/usr/sbin/nd-mcp` or `/usr/bin/nd-mcp`\n- **Static installations**: `/opt/netdata/usr/bin/nd-mcp`\n- **Built from source**: `/usr/local/netdata/usr/bin/nd-mcp`\n\n#### macOS\n\n```bash\n# Try these locations:\nwhich nd-mcp\nls -la /usr/local/bin/nd-mcp\nls -la /usr/local/netdata/usr/bin/nd-mcp\nls -la /opt/homebrew/bin/nd-mcp\n\n# Or search for it:\nfind / -name \"nd-mcp\" 2>/dev/null\n```\n\n#### Windows\n\n```powershell\n# Check common locations:\ndir \"C:\\Program Files\\Netdata\\usr\\bin\\nd-mcp.exe\"\ndir \"C:\\Netdata\\usr\\bin\\nd-mcp.exe\"\n# Or search for it:\nwhere nd-mcp.exe\n```\n\n### Option 2: Building nd-mcp for Your Desktop\n\nIf you don't have Netdata installed loca you can build just the nd-mcp bridge. Netdata provides three implementations - choose the one that best fits your environment:\n\n1. **Go bridge** (recommended) - [Go bridge source code](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/tree/master/src/web/mcp/bridges/stdio-golang)\n   - Produces a single binary with no dependencies\n   - Creates executable named `nd-mcp` (`nd-mcp.exe` on windows)\n   - Includes both `build.sh` and `build.bat` (for Windows)\n\n2. **Node.js bridge** - [Node.js bridge source code](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/tree/master/src/web/mcp/bridges/stdio-nodejs)\n   - Good if you already have Node.js installed\n   - Creates script named `nd-mcp.js`\n   - Includes `build.sh`\n\n3. **Python bridge** - [Python bridge source code](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/tree/master/src/web/mcp/bridges/stdio-python)\n   - Good if you already have Python installed\n   - Creates script named `nd-mcp.py`\n   - Includes `build.sh`\n\nTo build:\n\n```bash\n# Clone the Netdata repository\ngit clone https://github.com/netdata/netdata.git\ncd netdata\n\n# Choose your preferred implementation\ncd src/web/mcp/bridges/stdio-golang/  # or stdio-nodejs/ or stdio-python/\n\n# Build the bridge\n./build.sh  # On Windows with the Go version, use build.bat\n\n# The executable will be created with different names:\n# - Go: nd-mcp\n# - Node.js: nd-mcp.js\n# - Python: nd-mcp.py\n\n# Test the bridge with your Netdata instance (replace localhost with your Netdata IP)\n./nd-mcp ws://localhost:19999/mcp      # Go bridge\n./nd-mcp.js ws://localhost:19999/mcp   # Node.js bridge  \n./nd-mcp.py ws://localhost:19999/mcp   # Python bridge\n\n# You should see:\n# nd-mcp: Connecting to ws://localhost:19999/mcp...\n# nd-mcp: Connected\n# Press Ctrl+C to stop the test\n\n# Get the absolute path for your AI client configuration\npwd  # Shows current directory\n# Example output: /home/user/netdata/src/web/mcp/bridges/stdio-golang\n# Your nd-mcp path would be: /home/user/netdata/src/web/mcp/bridges/stdio-golang/nd-mcp\n```\n\n**Important**: When configuring your AI client, use the full absolute path to the executable:\n\n- Go bridge: `/path/to/bridges/stdio-golang/nd-mcp`\n- Node.js bridge: `/path/to/bridges/stdio-nodejs/nd-mcp.js`\n- Python bridge: `/path/to/bridges/stdio-python/nd-mcp.py`\n\n### Verify the Bridge Works\n\nOnce you have nd-mcp (either from existing installation or built), test it:\n\n```bash\n# Test connection to your Netdata instance (replace YOUR_NETDATA_IP with actual IP)\n/path/to/nd-mcp ws://YOUR_NETDATA_IP:19999/mcp\n\n# You should see:\n# nd-mcp: Connecting to ws://YOUR_NETDATA_IP:19999/mcp...\n# nd-mcp: Connected\n# Press Ctrl+C to stop the test\n```\n\n## Using MCP Remote Client\n\nThe official MCP remote client (`mcp-remote`) is an alternative bridge that enables stdio-only AI clients to connect to Netdata's HTTP and SSE transports (requires Netdata v2.7.2+). Unlike nd-mcp which only supports WebSocket, mcp-remote provides broader transport compatibility.\n\n### When to Use MCP Remote\n\nUse `mcp-remote` when:\n- Your AI client only supports stdio communication\n- You want to use HTTP or SSE transports instead of WebSocket\n- You're running Netdata v2.7.2 or later\n- You don't want to build/install nd-mcp\n\n### Installation\n\nNo installation required - `mcp-remote` runs via `npx`:\n\n```bash\n# Test the connection\nnpx mcp-remote@latest --http http://YOUR_NETDATA_IP:19999/mcp \\\n  --allow-http \\\n  --header \"Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY\"\n```\n\n### Transport Options\n\n`mcp-remote` supports multiple transport strategies:\n\n```bash\n# HTTP transport (recommended)\nnpx mcp-remote@latest --http http://YOUR_NETDATA_IP:19999/mcp \\\n  --allow-http \\\n  --header \"Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY\"\n\n# SSE transport\nnpx mcp-remote@latest --sse http://YOUR_NETDATA_IP:19999/mcp \\\n  --allow-http \\\n  --header \"Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY\"\n\n# Auto-detect with fallback (tries SSE first, falls back to HTTP)\nnpx mcp-remote@latest --transport sse-first http://YOUR_NETDATA_IP:19999/mcp \\\n  --allow-http \\\n  --header \"Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY\"\n\n# HTTPS (no --allow-http flag needed)\nnpx mcp-remote@latest --http https://YOUR_NETDATA_IP:19999/mcp \\\n  --header \"Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY\"\n```\n\n### Common Options\n\n| Option         | Description                                          | Example                                                 |\n|----------------|------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|\n| `--http`       | Use HTTP transport                                   | `--http http://host:19999/mcp`                          |\n| `--sse`        | Use SSE transport                                    | `--sse http://host:19999/mcp`                           |\n| `--allow-http` | Allow non-HTTPS connections (required for HTTP URLs) | `--allow-http`                                          |\n| `--header`     | Add custom headers (for authentication)              | `--header \"Authorization: Bearer KEY\"`                  |\n| `--transport`  | Transport strategy                                   | `--transport sse-first` (tries SSE, falls back to HTTP) |\n| `--debug`      | Enable debug logging                                 | `--debug`                                               |\n| `--host`       | OAuth callback host (default: localhost)             | `--host 127.0.0.1`                                      |\n| Port number    | OAuth callback port (optional)                       | `9696`                                                  |\n\n### Authentication\n\nFor Netdata MCP, pass the API key via the Authorization header:\n\n```bash\n# Using environment variable (recommended)\nexport NETDATA_MCP_API_KEY=\"$(cat /var/lib/netdata/mcp_dev_preview_api_key)\"\n\nnpx mcp-remote@latest --http http://YOUR_NETDATA_IP:19999/mcp \\\n  --allow-http \\\n  --header \"Authorization: Bearer $NETDATA_MCP_API_KEY\"\n```\n\n**Security Note:** The `--allow-http` flag is required for non-HTTPS connections. Only use this on trusted networks as traffic will not be encrypted.\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\n**Connection Issues:**\n```bash\n# Enable debug logging\nnpx mcp-remote@latest --debug --http http://YOUR_NETDATA_IP:19999/mcp \\\n  --allow-http \\\n  --header \"Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY\"\n\n# Check debug logs (stored in ~/.mcp-auth/)\ncat ~/.mcp-auth/*_debug.log\n```\n\n**Clear Authentication State:**\n```bash\n# Remove cached credentials\nrm -rf ~/.mcp-auth\n```\n\n**Spaces in Arguments:**\n\nSome AI clients (Cursor, Claude Desktop on Windows) have issues with spaces in arguments. Use environment variables as a workaround:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"netdata\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"mcp-remote@latest\",\n        \"--http\",\n        \"http://YOUR_IP:19999/mcp\",\n        \"--allow-http\",\n        \"--header\",\n        \"Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Version Management\n\nAlways use the latest version:\n\n```bash\n# Force npx to check for latest version\nnpx mcp-remote@latest --http http://YOUR_NETDATA_IP:19999/mcp\n```\n\nOr in AI client configurations:\n```json\n{\n  \"args\": [\"mcp-remote@latest\", \"--http\", \"...\"]\n}\n```\n\nFor more details, see the [official mcp-remote documentation](https://github.com/geelen/mcp-remote).\n\n## Finding Your API Key\n\nTo access sensitive functions like logs and live system information, you need an API key. Netdata automatically generates an API key on startup. The key is stored in a file on the Netdata server you want to connect to.\n\nYou need the API key of the Netdata you will connect to (usually a Netdata Parent).\n\n**Note**: This temporary API key mechanism will eventually be replaced by integration with Netdata Cloud.\n\n### Find the API Key File\n\n```bash\n# Try the default location first:\nsudo cat /var/lib/netdata/mcp_dev_preview_api_key\n\n# For static installations:\nsudo cat /opt/netdata/var/lib/netdata/mcp_dev_preview_api_key\n\n# If not found, search for it:\nsudo find / -name \"mcp_dev_preview_api_key\" 2>/dev/null\n```\n\n### Copy the API Key\n\nThe file contains a UUID that looks like:\n\n```\na1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890\n```\n\nCopy this entire string - you'll need it for your AI client configuration.\n\n### No API Key File?\n\nIf the file doesn't exist:\n\n1. Ensure you have a recent version of Netdata\n2. Restart Netdata: `sudo systemctl restart netdata`\n3. Check the file again after restart\n\n## AI Client Configuration\n\nAI clients can connect to Netdata MCP in different ways depending on their transport support:\n\n### Direct Connection (HTTP/SSE)\n\nFor AI clients that support HTTP or SSE transports:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"netdata\": {\n      \"type\": \"http\",\n      \"url\": \"http://IP_OF_YOUR_NETDATA:19999/mcp\",\n      \"headers\": [\n        \"Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nOr for SSE:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"netdata\": {\n      \"type\": \"sse\",\n      \"url\": \"http://IP_OF_YOUR_NETDATA:19999/mcp?transport=sse\",\n      \"headers\": [\n        \"Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Using nd-mcp Bridge (stdio)\n\nFor AI clients that only support stdio:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"netdata\": {\n      \"command\": \"/usr/sbin/nd-mcp\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"--bearer\",\n        \"YOUR_API_KEY\",\n        \"ws://IP_OF_YOUR_NETDATA:19999/mcp\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Using Official MCP Remote Client\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"netdata\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"mcp-remote@latest\",\n        \"--http\",\n        \"http://IP_OF_YOUR_NETDATA:19999/mcp\",\n        \"--header\",\n        \"Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nReplace:\n\n- `IP_OF_YOUR_NETDATA`: Your Netdata instance IP/hostname\n- `YOUR_API_KEY`: The API key from the file mentioned above\n- `/usr/sbin/nd-mcp`: With your actual nd-mcp path (if using the bridge)\n\n### Multiple MCP Servers\n\nYou can configure multiple Netdata instances:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"netdata-production\": {\n      \"command\": \"/usr/sbin/nd-mcp\",\n      \"args\": [\"--bearer\", \"PROD_KEY\", \"ws://prod-parent:19999/mcp\"]\n    },\n    \"netdata-testing\": {\n      \"command\": \"/usr/sbin/nd-mcp\",\n      \"args\": [\"--bearer\", \"TEST_KEY\", \"ws://test-parent:19999/mcp\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Legacy Query String Support\n\nFor compatibility with older tooling, Netdata still accepts the `?api_key=YOUR_API_KEY` query parameter on the `/mcp` endpoints. New integrations should prefer the `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY` header, but the query-string form remains available if you are migrating gradually.\n\n## AI Client Specific Documentation\n\nFor detailed configuration instructions for specific AI clients, see:\n\n**Chat Clients:**\n- [Claude Desktop](/docs/netdata-ai/mcp/mcp-clients/claude-desktop.md) - Anthropic's desktop AI assistant\n- [Cursor](/docs/netdata-ai/mcp/mcp-clients/cursor.md) - AI-powered code editor\n- [Visual Studio Code](/docs/netdata-ai/mcp/mcp-clients/vs-code.md) - VS Code with MCP support\n- [JetBrains IDEs](/docs/netdata-ai/mcp/mcp-clients/jetbrains-ides.md) - IntelliJ, PyCharm, WebStorm, etc.\n- [Netdata Web Client](/docs/netdata-ai/mcp/mcp-clients/netdata-web-client.md) - Built-in web-based AI chat\n\n**DevOps Copilots:**\n- [Claude Code](/docs/netdata-ai/mcp/mcp-clients/claude-code.md) - Anthropic's CLI for Claude\n- [Gemini CLI](/docs/netdata-ai/mcp/mcp-clients/gemini-cli.md) - Google's Gemini CLI\n- [OpenAI Codex CLI](/docs/netdata-ai/mcp/mcp-clients/codex-cli.md) - OpenAI's Codex CLI\n- [Crush](/docs/netdata-ai/mcp/mcp-clients/crush.md) - Charmbracelet's glamorous terminal AI\n- [OpenCode](/docs/netdata-ai/mcp/mcp-clients/opencode.md) - SST's terminal-based AI assistant\n\nEach guide includes specific transport support matrices and configuration examples optimized for that client.\n"

This temporary API key mechanism will eventually be replaced with a new authentication system integrated with Netdata Cloud.\n\nAI assistants have different visibility depending on where they connect:\n\n- **Netdata Cloud**: (coming soon) Full visibility across all nodes in your infrastructure\n- **Netdata Parent Node**: Visibility across all child nodes connected to that parent\n- **Netdata Child/Standalone Node**: Visibility only into that specific node\n\n## Transport Options\n\nNetdata implements the MCP protocol with multiple transport options:\n\n| Transport           | Endpoint                   | Use Case                                                     | Version Requirement  |\n|---------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|\n| **WebSocket**       | `ws://YOUR_IP:19999/mcp`   | Original transport, requires nd-mcp bridge for stdio clients | v2.6.0+              |\n| **HTTP Streamable** | `http://YOUR_IP:19999/mcp` | Direct connection from AI clients supporting HTTP            | v2.7.2+              |\n| **SSE**             | `http://YOUR_IP:19999/sse` | Server-Sent Events for real-time streaming                   | v2.7.2+              |\n\n- **Direct Connection** (v2.7.2+): AI clients that support HTTP or SSE transports can connect directly to Netdata\n- **Bridge Required**: AI clients that only support stdio need the `nd-mcp` (stdio-to-websocket) or `mcp-remote` (stdio-to-http or stdio-to-sse) bridge\n\n### Official MCP Remote Client (mcp-remote)\n\nIf your AI client doesn't support HTTP/SSE directly and you don't want to use `nd-mcp`, you can use the official MCP remote client (requires Netdata v2.7.2+):\n\n```bash\n# Export your MCP key once per shell\nexport NETDATA_MCP_API_KEY=\"$(cat /var/lib/netdata/mcp_dev_preview_api_key)\"\n\n# For HTTP transport\nnpx mcp-remote@latest --http http://YOUR_NETDATA_IP:19999/mcp \\\n  --allow-http \\\n  --header \"Authorization: Bearer $NETDATA_MCP_API_KEY\"\n\n# For SSE transport\nnpx mcp-remote@latest --sse http://YOUR_NETDATA_IP:19999/mcp \\\n  --allow-http \\\n  --header \"Authorization: Bearer $NETDATA_MCP_API_KEY\"\n```\n\n**Note:** The `--allow-http` flag is required for non-HTTPS connections. Only use this on trusted networks as traffic will not be encrypted.\n\n## Finding the nd-mcp Bridge\n\n> **Note**: With the new HTTP and SSE transports, many AI clients can now connect directly to Netdata without nd-mcp. Check your AI client's documentation to see if it supports direct HTTP or SSE connections.\n\nThe nd-mcp bridge is only needed for AI clients that:\n- Only support `stdio` communication (like some desktop applications)\n- Cannot use HTTP or SSE transports directly\n- Cannot use `npx mcp-remote@latest`\n\nThe `nd-mcp` bridge needs to be available on your desktop or laptop where your AI client runs. Since most users run Netdata on remote servers rather than their local machines, you have two options:\n\n1. **If you have Netdata installed locally** - Use the existing nd-mcp\n2. **If Netdata is only on remote servers** - Build nd-mcp on your desktop/laptop\n\n### Option 1: Using Existing nd-mcp\n\nIf you have Netdata installed on your desktop/laptop, find the existing bridge:\n\n#### Linux\n\n```bash\n# Try these locations in order:\nwhich nd-mcp\nls -la /usr/sbin/nd-mcp\nls -la /usr/bin/nd-mcp\nls -la /opt/netdata/usr/bin/nd-mcp\nls -la /usr/local/bin/nd-mcp\nls -la /usr/local/netdata/usr/bin/nd-mcp\n\n# Or search for it:\nfind / -name \"nd-mcp\" 2>/dev/null\n```\n\nCommon locations:\n\n- **Native packages (apt, yum, etc.)**: `/usr/sbin/nd-mcp` or `/usr/bin/nd-mcp`\n- **Static installations**: `/opt/netdata/usr/bin/nd-mcp`\n- **Built from source**: `/usr/local/netdata/usr/bin/nd-mcp`\n\n#### macOS\n\n```bash\n# Try these locations:\nwhich nd-mcp\nls -la /usr/local/bin/nd-mcp\nls -la /usr/local/netdata/usr/bin/nd-mcp\nls -la /opt/homebrew/bin/nd-mcp\n\n# Or search for it:\nfind / -name \"nd-mcp\" 2>/dev/null\n```\n\n#### Windows\n\n```powershell\n# Check common locations:\ndir \"C:\\Program Files\\Netdata\\usr\\bin\\nd-mcp.exe\"\ndir \"C:\\Netdata\\usr\\bin\\nd-mcp.exe\"\n# Or search for it:\nwhere nd-mcp.exe\n```\n\n### Option 2: Building nd-mcp for Your Desktop\n\nIf you don't have Netdata installed loca you can build just the nd-mcp bridge. Netdata provides three implementations - choose the one that best fits your environment:\n\n1. **Go bridge** (recommended) - [Go bridge source code](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/tree/master/src/web/mcp/bridges/stdio-golang)\n   - Produces a single binary with no dependencies\n   - Creates executable named `nd-mcp` (`nd-mcp.exe` on windows)\n   - Includes both `build.sh` and `build.bat` (for Windows)\n\n2. **Node.js bridge** - [Node.js bridge source code](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/tree/master/src/web/mcp/bridges/stdio-nodejs)\n   - Good if you already have Node.js installed\n   - Creates script named `nd-mcp.js`\n   - Includes `build.sh`\n\n3. **Python bridge** - [Python bridge source code](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/tree/master/src/web/mcp/bridges/stdio-python)\n   - Good if you already have Python installed\n   - Creates script named `nd-mcp.py`\n   - Includes `build.sh`\n\nTo build:\n\n```bash\n# Clone the Netdata repository\ngit clone https://github.com/netdata/netdata.git\ncd netdata\n\n# Choose your preferred implementation\ncd src/web/mcp/bridges/stdio-golang/  # or stdio-nodejs/ or stdio-python/\n\n# Build the bridge\n./build.sh  # On Windows with the Go version, use build.bat\n\n# The executable will be created with different names:\n# - Go: nd-mcp\n# - Node.js: nd-mcp.js\n# - Python: nd-mcp.py\n\n# Test the bridge with your Netdata instance (replace localhost with your Netdata IP)\n./nd-mcp ws://localhost:19999/mcp      # Go bridge\n./nd-mcp.js ws://localhost:19999/mcp   # Node.js bridge  \n./nd-mcp.py ws://localhost:19999/mcp   # Python bridge\n\n# You should see:\n# nd-mcp: Connecting to ws://localhost:19999/mcp...\n# nd-mcp: Connected\n# Press Ctrl+C to stop the test\n\n# Get the absolute path for your AI client configuration\npwd  # Shows current directory\n# Example output: /home/user/netdata/src/web/mcp/bridges/stdio-golang\n# Your nd-mcp path would be: /home/user/netdata/src/web/mcp/bridges/stdio-golang/nd-mcp\n```\n\n**Important**: When configuring your AI client, use the full absolute path to the executable:\n\n- Go bridge: `/path/to/bridges/stdio-golang/nd-mcp`\n- Node.js bridge: `/path/to/bridges/stdio-nodejs/nd-mcp.js`\n- Python bridge: `/path/to/bridges/stdio-python/nd-mcp.py`\n\n### Verify the Bridge Works\n\nOnce you have nd-mcp (either from existing installation or built), test it:\n\n```bash\n# Test connection to your Netdata instance (replace YOUR_NETDATA_IP with actual IP)\n/path/to/nd-mcp ws://YOUR_NETDATA_IP:19999/mcp\n\n# You should see:\n# nd-mcp: Connecting to ws://YOUR_NETDATA_IP:19999/mcp...\n# nd-mcp: Connected\n# Press Ctrl+C to stop the test\n```\n\n## Using MCP Remote Client\n\nThe official MCP remote client (`mcp-remote`) is an alternative bridge that enables stdio-only AI clients to connect to Netdata's HTTP and SSE transports (requires Netdata v2.7.2+). Unlike nd-mcp which only supports WebSocket, mcp-remote provides broader transport compatibility.\n\n### When to Use MCP Remote\n\nUse `mcp-remote` when:\n- Your AI client only supports stdio communication\n- You want to use HTTP or SSE transports instead of WebSocket\n- You're running Netdata v2.7.2 or later\n- You don't want to build/install nd-mcp\n\n### Installation\n\nNo installation required - `mcp-remote` runs via `npx`:\n\n```bash\n# Test the connection\nnpx mcp-remote@latest --http http://YOUR_NETDATA_IP:19999/mcp \\\n  --allow-http \\\n  --header \"Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY\"\n```\n\n### Transport Options\n\n`mcp-remote` supports multiple transport strategies:\n\n```bash\n# HTTP transport (recommended)\nnpx mcp-remote@latest --http http://YOUR_NETDATA_IP:19999/mcp \\\n  --allow-http \\\n  --header \"Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY\"\n\n# SSE transport\nnpx mcp-remote@latest --sse http://YOUR_NETDATA_IP:19999/mcp \\\n  --allow-http \\\n  --header \"Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY\"\n\n# Auto-detect with fallback (tries SSE first, falls back to HTTP)\nnpx mcp-remote@latest --transport sse-first http://YOUR_NETDATA_IP:19999/mcp \\\n  --allow-http \\\n  --header \"Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY\"\n\n# HTTPS (no --allow-http flag needed)\nnpx mcp-remote@latest --http https://YOUR_NETDATA_IP:19999/mcp \\\n  --header \"Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY\"\n```\n\n### Common Options\n\n| Option         | Description                                          | Example                                                 |\n|----------------|------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|\n| `--http`       | Use HTTP transport                                   | `--http http://host:19999/mcp`                          |\n| `--sse`        | Use SSE transport                                    | `--sse http://host:19999/mcp`                           |\n| `--allow-http` | Allow non-HTTPS connections (required for HTTP URLs) | `--allow-http`                                          |\n| `--header`     | Add custom headers (for authentication)              | `--header \"Authorization: Bearer KEY\"`                  |\n| `--transport`  | Transport strategy                                   | `--transport sse-first` (tries SSE, falls back to HTTP) |\n| `--debug`      | Enable debug logging                                 | `--debug`                                               |\n| `--host`       | OAuth callback host (default: localhost)             | `--host 127.0.0.1`                                      |\n| Port number    | OAuth callback port (optional)                       | `9696`                                                  |\n\n### Authentication\n\nFor Netdata MCP, pass the API key via the Authorization header:\n\n```bash\n# Using environment variable (recommended)\nexport NETDATA_MCP_API_KEY=\"$(cat /var/lib/netdata/mcp_dev_preview_api_key)\"\n\nnpx mcp-remote@latest --http http://YOUR_NETDATA_IP:19999/mcp \\\n  --allow-http \\\n  --header \"Authorization: Bearer $NETDATA_MCP_API_KEY\"\n```\n\n**Security Note:** The `--allow-http` flag is required for non-HTTPS connections. Only use this on trusted networks as traffic will not be encrypted.\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\n**Connection Issues:**\n```bash\n# Enable debug logging\nnpx mcp-remote@latest --debug --http http://YOUR_NETDATA_IP:19999/mcp \\\n  --allow-http \\\n  --header \"Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY\"\n\n# Check debug logs (stored in ~/.mcp-auth/)\ncat ~/.mcp-auth/*_debug.log\n```\n\n**Clear Authentication State:**\n```bash\n# Remove cached credentials\nrm -rf ~/.mcp-auth\n```\n\n**Spaces in Arguments:**\n\nSome AI clients (Cursor, Claude Desktop on Windows) have issues with spaces in arguments. Use environment variables as a workaround:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"netdata\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"mcp-remote@latest\",\n        \"--http\",\n        \"http://YOUR_IP:19999/mcp\",\n        \"--allow-http\",\n        \"--header\",\n        \"Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Version Management\n\nAlways use the latest version:\n\n```bash\n# Force npx to check for latest version\nnpx mcp-remote@latest --http http://YOUR_NETDATA_IP:19999/mcp\n```\n\nOr in AI client configurations:\n```json\n{\n  \"args\": [\"mcp-remote@latest\", \"--http\", \"...\"]\n}\n```\n\nFor more details, see the [official mcp-remote documentation](https://github.com/geelen/mcp-remote).\n\n## Finding Your API Key\n\nTo access sensitive functions like logs and live system information, you need an API key. Netdata automatically generates an API key on startup. The key is stored in a file on the Netdata server you want to connect to.\n\nYou need the API key of the Netdata you will connect to (usually a Netdata Parent).\n\n**Note**: This temporary API key mechanism will eventually be replaced by integration with Netdata Cloud.\n\n### Find the API Key File\n\n```bash\n# Try the default location first:\nsudo cat /var/lib/netdata/mcp_dev_preview_api_key\n\n# For static installations:\nsudo cat /opt/netdata/var/lib/netdata/mcp_dev_preview_api_key\n\n# If not found, search for it:\nsudo find / -name \"mcp_dev_preview_api_key\" 2>/dev/null\n```\n\n### Copy the API Key\n\nThe file contains a UUID that looks like:\n\n```\na1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890\n```\n\nCopy this entire string - you'll need it for your AI client configuration.\n\n### No API Key File?\n\nIf the file doesn't exist:\n\n1. Ensure you have a recent version of Netdata\n2. Restart Netdata: `sudo systemctl restart netdata`\n3. Check the file again after restart\n\n## AI Client Configuration\n\nAI clients can connect to Netdata MCP in different ways depending on their transport support:\n\n### Direct Connection (HTTP/SSE)\n\nFor AI clients that support HTTP or SSE transports:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"netdata\": {\n      \"type\": \"http\",\n      \"url\": \"http://IP_OF_YOUR_NETDATA:19999/mcp\",\n      \"headers\": [\n        \"Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nOr for SSE:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"netdata\": {\n      \"type\": \"sse\",\n      \"url\": \"http://IP_OF_YOUR_NETDATA:19999/mcp?transport=sse\",\n      \"headers\": [\n        \"Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Using nd-mcp Bridge (stdio)\n\nFor AI clients that only support stdio:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"netdata\": {\n      \"command\": \"/usr/sbin/nd-mcp\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"--bearer\",\n        \"YOUR_API_KEY\",\n        \"ws://IP_OF_YOUR_NETDATA:19999/mcp\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Using Official MCP Remote Client\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"netdata\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"mcp-remote@latest\",\n        \"--http\",\n        \"http://IP_OF_YOUR_NETDATA:19999/mcp\",\n        \"--header\",\n        \"Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nReplace:\n\n- `IP_OF_YOUR_NETDATA`: Your Netdata instance IP/hostname\n- `YOUR_API_KEY`: The API key from the file mentioned above\n- `/usr/sbin/nd-mcp`: With your actual nd-mcp path (if using the bridge)\n\n### Multiple MCP Servers\n\nYou can configure multiple Netdata instances:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"netdata-production\": {\n      \"command\": \"/usr/sbin/nd-mcp\",\n      \"args\": [\"--bearer\", \"PROD_KEY\", \"ws://prod-parent:19999/mcp\"]\n    },\n    \"netdata-testing\": {\n      \"command\": \"/usr/sbin/nd-mcp\",\n      \"args\": [\"--bearer\", \"TEST_KEY\", \"ws://test-parent:19999/mcp\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Legacy Query String Support\n\nFor compatibility with older tooling, Netdata still accepts the `?api_key=YOUR_API_KEY` query parameter on the `/mcp` endpoints. New integrations should prefer the `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY` header, but the query-string form remains available if you are migrating gradually.\n\n## AI Client Specific Documentation\n\nFor detailed configuration instructions for specific AI clients, see:\n\n**Chat Clients:**\n- [Claude Desktop](/docs/netdata-ai/mcp/mcp-clients/claude-desktop.md) - Anthropic's desktop AI assistant\n- [Cursor](/docs/netdata-ai/mcp/mcp-clients/cursor.md) - AI-powered code editor\n- [Visual Studio Code](/docs/netdata-ai/mcp/mcp-clients/vs-code.md) - VS Code with MCP support\n- [JetBrains IDEs](/docs/netdata-ai/mcp/mcp-clients/jetbrains-ides.md) - IntelliJ, PyCharm, WebStorm, etc.\n- [Netdata Web Client](/docs/netdata-ai/mcp/mcp-clients/netdata-web-client.md) - Built-in web-based AI chat\n\n**DevOps Copilots:**\n- [Claude Code](/docs/netdata-ai/mcp/mcp-clients/claude-code.md) - Anthropic's CLI for Claude\n- [Gemini CLI](/docs/netdata-ai/mcp/mcp-clients/gemini-cli.md) - Google's Gemini CLI\n- [OpenAI Codex CLI](/docs/netdata-ai/mcp/mcp-clients/codex-cli.md) - OpenAI's Codex CLI\n- [Crush](/docs/netdata-ai/mcp/mcp-clients/crush.md) - Charmbracelet's glamorous terminal AI\n- [OpenCode](/docs/netdata-ai/mcp/mcp-clients/opencode.md) - SST's terminal-based AI assistant\n\nEach guide includes specific transport support matrices and configuration examples optimized for that client.\n",

That way, Context7 MCP server can skip the library-matching step and directly continue with retrieving docs.\n\n```txt\nImplement basic authentication with Supabase. use library /supabase/supabase for API and docs.\n```\n\nThe slash syntax tells the MCP tool exactly which library to load docs for.\n\n### Specify a Version\n\nTo get documentation for a specific library version, just mention the version in your prompt:\n\n```txt\nHow do I set up Next.js 14 middleware? use context7\n```\n\nContext7 will automatically match the appropriate version.\n\n## Available Tools\n\nContext7 MCP provides the following tools that LLMs can use:\n\n- `resolve-library-id`: Resolves a general library name into a Context7-compatible library ID.\n  - `query` (required): The user's question or task (used to rank results by relevance)\n  - `libraryName` (required): The name of the library to search for\n\n- `query-docs`: Retrieves documentation for a library using a Context7-compatible library ID.\n  - `libraryId` (required): Exact Context7-compatible library ID (e.g., `/mongodb/docs`, `/vercel/next.js`)\n  - `query` (required): The question or task to get relevant documentation for\n\n## More Documentation\n\n- [More MCP Clients](https://context7.com/docs/all-clients) - Installation for 30+ clients\n- [Adding Libraries](https://context7.com/docs/adding-libraries) - Submit your library to Context7\n- [Troubleshooting](https://context7.com/docs/troubleshooting) - Common issues and solutions\n- [API Reference](https://context7.com/docs/api) - REST API documentation\n- [Developer Guide](https://context7.com/docs/developer) - Run Context7 locally\n\n## Disclaimer\n\n1- Context7 projects are community-contributed and while we strive to maintain high quality, we cannot guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or security of all library documentation.

If your MCP host does not support remote MCP servers, don't worry! You can use the [local version of the GitHub MCP Server](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server?tab=readme-ov-file#local-github-mcp-server) instead.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n1. A compatible MCP host with remote server support (VS Code 1.101+, Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.)\n2. Any applicable [policies enabled](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server/blob/main/docs/policies-and-governance.md)\n\n### Install in VS Code\n\nFor quick installation, use one of the one-click install buttons above. Once you complete that flow, toggle Agent mode (located by the Copilot Chat text input) and the server will start. Make sure you're using [VS Code 1.101](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_101) or [later](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates) for remote MCP and OAuth support.\n\nAlternatively, to manually configure VS Code, choose the appropriate JSON block from the examples below and add it to your host configuration:\n\n<table>\n<tr><th>Using OAuth</th><th>Using a GitHub PAT</th></tr>\n<tr><th align=left colspan=2>VS Code (version 1.101 or greater)</th></tr>\n<tr valign=top>\n<td>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"servers\": {\n    \"github\": {\n      \"type\": \"http\",\n      \"url\": \"https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n</td>\n<td>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"servers\": {\n    \"github\": {\n      \"type\": \"http\",\n      \"url\": \"https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/\",\n      \"headers\": {\n        \"Authorization\": \"Bearer ${input:github_mcp_pat}\"\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  \"inputs\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"promptString\",\n      \"id\": \"github_mcp_pat\",\n      \"description\": \"GitHub Personal Access Token\",\n      \"password\": true\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n### Install in other MCP hosts\n- **[GitHub Copilot in other IDEs](/docs/installation-guides/install-other-copilot-ides.md)** - Installation for JetBrains, Visual Studio, Eclipse, and Xcode with GitHub Copilot\n- **[Claude Applications](/docs/installation-guides/install-claude.md)** - Installation guide for Claude Desktop and Claude Code CLI\n- **[Codex](/docs/installation-guides/install-codex.md)** - Installation guide for Open AI Codex\n- **[Cursor](/docs/installation-guides/install-cursor.md)** - Installation guide for Cursor IDE\n- **[Windsurf](/docs/installation-guides/install-windsurf.md)** - Installation guide for Windsurf IDE\n\n> **Note:** Each MCP host application needs to configure a GitHub App or OAuth App to support remote access via OAuth. Any host application that supports remote MCP servers should support the remote GitHub server with PAT authentication. Configuration details and support levels vary by host. Make sure to refer to the host application's documentation for more info.\n\n### Configuration\n\n#### Toolset configuration\n\nSee [Remote Server Documentation](docs/remote-server.md) for full details on remote server configuration, toolsets, headers, and advanced usage. This file provides comprehensive instructions and examples for connecting, customizing, and installing the remote GitHub MCP Server in VS Code and other MCP hosts.\n\nWhen no toolsets are specified, [default toolsets](#default-toolset) are used.\n\n#### GitHub Enterprise\n\n##### GitHub Enterprise Cloud with data residency (ghe.com)\n\nGitHub Enterprise Cloud can also make use of the remote server.\n\nExample for `https://octocorp.ghe.com` with GitHub PAT token:\n```\n{\n    ...\n    \"proxima-github\": {\n      \"type\": \"http\",\n      \"url\": \"https://copilot-api.octocorp.ghe.com/mcp\",\n      \"headers\": {\n        \"Authorization\": \"Bearer ${input:github_mcp_pat}\"\n      }\n    },\n    ...\n}\n```\n\n> **Note:** When using OAuth with GitHub Enterprise with VS Code and GitHub Copilot, you also need to configure your VS Code settings to point to your GitHub Enterprise instance - see [Authenticate from VS Code](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/how-tos/configure-personal-settings/authenticate-to-ghecom)\n\n##### GitHub Enterprise Server\n\nGitHub Enterprise Server does not support remote server hosting. Please refer to [GitHub Enterprise Server and Enterprise Cloud with data residency (ghe.com)](#github-enterprise-server-and-enterprise-cloud-with-data-residency-ghecom) from the local server configuration.\n\n---\n\n## Local GitHub MCP Server\n\n[![Install with Docker in VS Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code-Install_Server-0098FF?style=flat-square&logo=visualstudiocode&logoColor=white)](https://insiders.vscode.dev/redirect/mcp/install?name=github&inputs=%5B%7B%22id%22%3A%22github_token%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22promptString%22%2C%22description%22%3A%22GitHub%20Personal%20Access%20Token%22%2C%22password%22%3Atrue%7D%5D&config=%7B%22command%22%3A%22docker%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22run%22%2C%22-i%22%2C%22--rm%22%2C%22-e%22%2C%22GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN%22%2C%22ghcr.io%2Fgithub%2Fgithub-mcp-server%22%5D%2C%22env%22%3A%7B%22GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN%22%3A%22%24%7Binput%3Agithub_token%7D%22%7D%7D) [![Install with Docker in VS Code Insiders](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code_Insiders-Install_Server-24bfa5?style=flat-square&logo=visualstudiocode&logoColor=white)](https://insiders.vscode.dev/redirect/mcp/install?name=github&inputs=%5B%7B%22id%22%3A%22github_token%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22promptString%22%2C%22description%22%3A%22GitHub%20Personal%20Access%20Token%22%2C%22password%22%3Atrue%7D%5D&config=%7B%22command%22%3A%22docker%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22run%22%2C%22-i%22%2C%22--rm%22%2C%22-e%22%2C%22GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN%22%2C%22ghcr.io%2Fgithub%2Fgithub-mcp-server%22%5D%2C%22env%22%3A%7B%22GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN%22%3A%22%24%7Binput%3Agithub_token%7D%22%7D%7D&quality=insiders)\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n1. To run the server in a container, you will need to have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed.\n2. Once Docker is installed, you will also need to ensure Docker is running. The Docker image is available at `ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server`. The image is public; if you get errors on pull, you may have an expired token and need to `docker logout ghcr.io`.\n3. Lastly you will need to [Create a GitHub Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new).\nThe MCP server can use many of the GitHub APIs, so enable the permissions that you feel comfortable granting your AI tools (to learn more about access tokens, please check out the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens)).\n\n<details><summary><b>Handling PATs Securely</b></summary>\n\n### Environment Variables (Recommended)\nTo keep your GitHub PAT secure and reusable across different MCP hosts:\n\n1. **Store your PAT in environment variables**\n   ```bash\n   export GITHUB_PAT=your_token_here\n   ```\n   Or create a `.env` file:\n   ```env\n   GITHUB_PAT=your_token_here\n   ```\n\n2. **Protect your `.env` file**\n   ```bash\n   # Add to .gitignore to prevent accidental commits\n   echo \".env\" >> .gitignore\n   ```\n\n3. **Reference the token in configurations**\n   ```bash\n   # CLI usage\n   claude mcp update github -e GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=$GITHUB_PAT\n\n   # In config files (where supported)\n   \"env\": {\n     \"GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN\": \"$GITHUB_PAT\"\n   }\n   ```\n\n> **Note**: Environment variable support varies by host app and IDE. Some applications (like Windsurf) require hardcoded tokens in config files.\n\n### Token Security Best Practices\n\n- **Minimum scopes**: Only grant necessary permissions\n  - `repo` - Repository operations\n  - `read:packages` - Docker image access\n  - `read:org` - Organization team access\n- **Separate tokens**: Use different PATs for different projects/environments\n- **Regular rotation**: Update tokens periodically\n- **Never commit**: Keep tokens out of version control\n- **File permissions**: Restrict access to config files containing tokens\n  ```bash\n  chmod 600 ~/.your-app/config.json\n  ```\n\n</details>\n\n### GitHub Enterprise Server and Enterprise Cloud with data residency (ghe.com)\n\nThe flag `--gh-host` and the environment variable `GITHUB_HOST` can be used to set\nthe hostname for GitHub Enterprise Server or GitHub Enterprise Cloud with data residency.\n\n- For GitHub Enterprise Server, prefix the hostname with the `https://` URI scheme, as it otherwise defaults to `http://`, which GitHub Enterprise Server does not support.\n- For GitHub Enterprise Cloud with data residency, use `https://YOURSUBDOMAIN.ghe.com` as the hostname.\n``` json\n\"github\": {\n    \"command\": \"docker\",\n    \"args\": [\n    \"run\",\n    \"-i\",\n    \"--rm\",\n    \"-e\",\n    \"GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN\",\n    \"-e\",\n    \"GITHUB_HOST\",\n    \"ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server\"\n    ],\n    \"env\": {\n        \"GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN\": \"${input:github_token}\",\n        \"GITHUB_HOST\": \"https://<your GHES or ghe.com domain name>\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Installation\n\n### Install in GitHub Copilot on VS Code\n\nFor quick installation, use one of the one-click install buttons above. Once you complete that flow, toggle Agent mode (located by the Copilot Chat text input) and the server will start.\n\nMore about using MCP server tools in VS Code's [agent mode documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers).\n\nInstall in GitHub Copilot on other IDEs (JetBrains, Visual Studio, Eclipse, etc.)\n\nAdd the following JSON block to your IDE's MCP settings.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcp\": {\n    \"inputs\": [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"promptString\",\n        \"id\": \"github_token\",\n        \"description\": \"GitHub Personal Access Token\",\n        \"password\": true\n      }\n    ],\n    \"servers\": {\n      \"github\": {\n        \"command\": \"docker\",\n        \"args\": [\n          \"run\",\n          \"-i\",\n          \"--rm\",\n          \"-e\",\n          \"GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN\",\n          \"ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server\"\n        ],\n        \"env\": {\n          \"GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN\": \"${input:github_token}\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nOptionally, you can add a similar example (i.e. without the mcp key) to a file called `.vscode/mcp.json` in your workspace. This will allow you to share the configuration with other host applications that accept the same format.\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>Example JSON block without the MCP key included</b></summary>\n<br>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"inputs\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"promptString\",\n      \"id\": \"github_token\",\n      \"description\": \"GitHub Personal Access Token\",\n      \"password\": true\n    }\n  ],\n  \"servers\": {\n    \"github\": {\n      \"command\": \"docker\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"run\",\n        \"-i\",\n        \"--rm\",\n        \"-e\",\n        \"GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN\",\n        \"ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server\"\n      ],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN\": \"${input:github_token}\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n</details>\n\n### Install in Other MCP Hosts\n\nFor other MCP host applications, please refer to our installation guides:\n\n- **[GitHub Copilot in other IDEs](/docs/installation-guides/install-other-copilot-ides.md)** - Installation for JetBrains, Visual Studio, Eclipse, and Xcode with GitHub Copilot\n- **[Claude Code & Claude Desktop](docs/installation-guides/install-claude.md)** - Installation guide for Claude Code and Claude Desktop\n- **[Cursor](docs/installation-guides/install-cursor.md)** - Installation guide for Cursor IDE\n- **[Google Gemini CLI](docs/installation-guides/install-gemini-cli.md)** - Installation guide for Google Gemini CLI\n- **[Windsurf](docs/installation-guides/install-windsurf.md)** - Installation guide for Windsurf IDE\n\nFor a complete overview of all installation options, see our **[Installation Guides Index](docs/installation-guides)**.\n\n> **Note:** Any host application that supports local MCP servers should be able to access the local GitHub MCP server. However, the specific configuration process, syntax and stability of the integration will vary by host application. While many may follow a similar format to the examples above, this is not guaranteed. Please refer to your host application's documentation for the correct MCP configuration syntax and setup process.\n\n### Build from source\n\nIf you don't have Docker, you can use `go build` to build the binary in the\n`cmd/github-mcp-server` directory, and use the `github-mcp-server stdio` command with the `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable set to your token. To specify the output location of the build, use the `-o` flag. You should configure your server to use the built executable as its `command`. For example:\n\n```JSON\n{\n  \"mcp\": {\n    \"servers\": {\n      \"github\": {\n        \"command\": \"/path/to/github-mcp-server\",\n        \"args\": [\"stdio\"],\n        \"env\": {\n          \"GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN\": \"<YOUR_TOKEN>\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Tool Configuration\n\nThe GitHub MCP Server supports enabling or disabling specific groups of functionalities via the `--toolsets` flag. This allows you to control which GitHub API capabilities are available to your AI tools. Enabling only the toolsets that you need can help the LLM with tool choice and reduce the context size.\n\n_Toolsets are not limited to Tools. Relevant MCP Resources and Prompts are also included where applicable._\n\nWhen no toolsets are specified, [default toolsets](#default-toolset) are used.\n\n> **Looking for examples?** See the [Server Configuration Guide](./docs/server-configuration.md) for common recipes like minimal setups, read-only mode, and combining tools with toolsets.\n\n#### Specifying Toolsets\n\nTo specify toolsets you want available to the LLM, you can pass an allow-list in two ways:\n\n1. **Using Command Line Argument**:\n\n   ```bash\n   github-mcp-server --toolsets repos,issues,pull_requests,actions,code_security\n   ```\n\n2. **Using Environment Variable**:\n   ```bash\n   GITHUB_TOOLSETS=\"repos,issues,pull_requests,actions,code_security\" ./github-mcp-server\n   ```\n\nThe environment variable `GITHUB_TOOLSETS` takes precedence over the command line argument if both are provided.\n\n#### Specifying Individual Tools\n\nYou can also configure specific tools using the `--tools` flag. Tools can be used independently or combined with toolsets and dynamic toolsets discovery for fine-grained control.\n\n1. **Using Command Line Argument**:\n\n   ```bash\n   github-mcp-server --tools get_file_contents,issue_read,create_pull_request\n   ```\n\n2. **Using Environment Variable**:\n   ```bash\n   GITHUB_TOOLS=\"get_file_contents,issue_read,create_pull_request\" ./github-mcp-server\n   ```\n\n3. **Combining with Toolsets** (additive):\n   ```bash\n   github-mcp-server --toolsets repos,issues --tools get_gist\n   ```\n   This registers all tools from `repos` and `issues` toolsets, plus `get_gist`.\n\n4. **Combining with Dynamic Toolsets** (additive):\n   ```bash\n   github-mcp-server --tools get_file_contents --dynamic-toolsets\n   ```\n   This registers `get_file_contents` plus the dynamic toolset tools (`enable_toolset`, `list_available_toolsets`, `get_toolset_tools`).\n\n**Important Notes:**\n- Tools, toolsets, and dynamic toolsets can all be used together\n- Read-only mode takes priority: write tools are skipped if `--read-only` is set, even if explicitly requested via `--tools`\n- Tool names must match exactly (e.g., `get_file_contents`, not `getFileContents`). Invalid tool names will cause the server to fail at startup with an error message\n- When tools are renamed, old names are preserved as aliases for backward compatibility. See [Deprecated Tool Aliases](docs/deprecated-tool-aliases.md) for details.\n\n### Using Toolsets With Docker\n\nWhen using Docker, you can pass the toolsets as environment variables:\n\n```bash\ndocker run -i --rm \\\n  -e GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your-token> \\\n  -e GITHUB_TOOLSETS=\"repos,issues,pull_requests,actions,code_security\" \\\n  ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server\n```\n\n### Using Tools With Docker\n\nWhen using Docker, you can pass specific tools as environment variables. You can also combine tools with toolsets:\n\n```bash\n# Tools only\ndocker run -i --rm \\\n  -e GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your-token> \\\n  -e GITHUB_TOOLS=\"get_file_contents,issue_read,create_pull_request\" \\\n  ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server\n\n# Tools combined with toolsets (additive)\ndocker run -i --rm \\\n  -e GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your-token> \\\n  -e GITHUB_TOOLSETS=\"repos,issues\" \\\n  -e GITHUB_TOOLS=\"get_gist\" \\\n  ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server\n```\n\n### Special toolsets\n\n#### \"all\" toolset\n\nThe special toolset `all` can be provided to enable all available toolsets regardless of any other configuration:\n\n```bash\n./github-mcp-server --toolsets all\n```\n\nOr using the environment variable:\n\n```bash\nGITHUB_TOOLSETS=\"all\" ./github-mcp-server\n```\n\n#### \"default\" toolset\nThe default toolset `default` is the configuration that gets passed to the server if no toolsets are specified.\n\nThe default configuration is:\n- context\n- repos\n- issues\n- pull_requests\n- users\n\nTo keep the default configuration and add additional toolsets:\n\n```bash\nGITHUB_TOOLSETS=\"default,stargazers\" ./github-mcp-server\n```\n\n### Available Toolsets\n\nThe following sets of tools are available:\n\n<!-- START AUTOMATED TOOLSETS -->\n|

Please test it out and let us know if you encounter any issues.\n\nInstead of starting with all tools enabled, you can turn on dynamic toolset discovery. Dynamic toolsets allow the MCP host to list and enable toolsets in response to a user prompt. This should help to avoid situations where the model gets confused by the sheer number of tools available.\n\n### Using Dynamic Tool Discovery\n\nWhen using the binary, you can pass the `--dynamic-toolsets` flag.\n\n```bash\n./github-mcp-server --dynamic-toolsets\n```\n\nWhen using Docker, you can pass the toolsets as environment variables:\n\n```bash\ndocker run -i --rm \\\n  -e GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your-token> \\\n  -e GITHUB_DYNAMIC_TOOLSETS=1 \\\n  ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server\n```\n\n## Read-Only Mode\n\nTo run the server in read-only mode, you can use the `--read-only` flag. This will only offer read-only tools, preventing any modifications to repositories, issues, pull requests, etc.\n\n```bash\n./github-mcp-server --read-only\n```\n\nWhen using Docker, you can pass the read-only mode as an environment variable:\n\n```bash\ndocker run -i --rm \\\n  -e GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your-token> \\\n  -e GITHUB_READ_ONLY=1 \\\n  ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server\n```\n\n## Lockdown Mode\n\nLockdown mode limits the content that the server will surface from public repositories. When enabled, the server checks whether the author of each item has push access to the repository. Private repositories are unaffected, and collaborators keep full access to their own content.\n\n```bash\n./github-mcp-server --lockdown-mode\n```\n\nWhen running with Docker, set the corresponding environment variable:\n\n```bash\ndocker run -i --rm \\\n  -e GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your-token> \\\n  -e GITHUB_LOCKDOWN_MODE=1 \\\n  ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server\n```\n\nThe behavior of lockdown mode depends on the tool invoked.\n\nFollowing tools will return an error when the author lacks the push access:\n\n- `issue_read:get`\n- `pull_request_read:get`\n\nFollowing tools will filter out content from users lacking the push access:\n\n- `issue_read:get_comments`\n- `issue_read:get_sub_issues`\n- `pull_request_read:get_comments`\n- `pull_request_read:get_review_comments`\n- `pull_request_read:get_reviews`\n\n## i18n / Overriding Descriptions\n\nThe descriptions of the tools can be overridden by creating a\n`github-mcp-server-config.json` file in the same directory as the binary.\n\nThe file should contain a JSON object with the tool names as keys and the new\ndescriptions as values. For example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"TOOL_ADD_ISSUE_COMMENT_DESCRIPTION\": \"an alternative description\",\n  \"TOOL_CREATE_BRANCH_DESCRIPTION\": \"Create a new branch in a GitHub repository\"\n}\n```\n\nYou can create an export of the current translations by running the binary with\nthe `--export-translations` flag.\n\nThis flag will preserve any translations/overrides you have made, while adding\nany new translations that have been added to the binary since the last time you\nexported.\n\n```sh\n./github-mcp-server --export-translations\ncat github-mcp-server-config.json\n```\n\nYou can also use ENV vars to override the descriptions. The environment\nvariable names are the same as the keys in the JSON file, prefixed with\n`GITHUB_MCP_` and all uppercase.\n\nFor example, to override the `TOOL_ADD_ISSUE_COMMENT_DESCRIPTION` tool, you can\nset the following environment variable:\n\n```sh\nexport GITHUB_MCP_TOOL_ADD_ISSUE_COMMENT_DESCRIPTION=\"an alternative description\"\n```\n\n## Library Usage\n\nThe exported Go API of this module should currently be considered unstable, and subject to breaking changes. In the future, we may offer stability; please file an issue if there is a use case where this would be valuable.\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under the terms of the MIT open source license.

If your MCP host does not support remote MCP servers, don't worry! You can use the [local version of the GitHub MCP Server](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server?tab=readme-ov-file#local-github-mcp-server) instead.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n1. A compatible MCP host with remote server support (VS Code 1.101+, Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.)\n2. Any applicable [policies enabled](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server/blob/main/docs/policies-and-governance.md)\n\n### Install in VS Code\n\nFor quick installation, use one of the one-click install buttons above. Once you complete that flow, toggle Agent mode (located by the Copilot Chat text input) and the server will start. Make sure you're using [VS Code 1.101](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_101) or [later](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates) for remote MCP and OAuth support.\n\nAlternatively, to manually configure VS Code, choose the appropriate JSON block from the examples below and add it to your host configuration:\n\n<table>\n<tr><th>Using OAuth</th><th>Using a GitHub PAT</th></tr>\n<tr><th align=left colspan=2>VS Code (version 1.101 or greater)</th></tr>\n<tr valign=top>\n<td>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"servers\": {\n    \"github\": {\n      \"type\": \"http\",\n      \"url\": \"https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n</td>\n<td>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"servers\": {\n    \"github\": {\n      \"type\": \"http\",\n      \"url\": \"https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/\",\n      \"headers\": {\n        \"Authorization\": \"Bearer ${input:github_mcp_pat}\"\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  \"inputs\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"promptString\",\n      \"id\": \"github_mcp_pat\",\n      \"description\": \"GitHub Personal Access Token\",\n      \"password\": true\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n### Install in other MCP hosts\n- **[GitHub Copilot in other IDEs](/docs/installation-guides/install-other-copilot-ides.md)** - Installation for JetBrains, Visual Studio, Eclipse, and Xcode with GitHub Copilot\n- **[Claude Applications](/docs/installation-guides/install-claude.md)** - Installation guide for Claude Desktop and Claude Code CLI\n- **[Codex](/docs/installation-guides/install-codex.md)** - Installation guide for Open AI Codex\n- **[Cursor](/docs/installation-guides/install-cursor.md)** - Installation guide for Cursor IDE\n- **[Windsurf](/docs/installation-guides/install-windsurf.md)** - Installation guide for Windsurf IDE\n\n> **Note:** Each MCP host application needs to configure a GitHub App or OAuth App to support remote access via OAuth. Any host application that supports remote MCP servers should support the remote GitHub server with PAT authentication. Configuration details and support levels vary by host. Make sure to refer to the host application's documentation for more info.\n\n### Configuration\n\n#### Toolset configuration\n\nSee [Remote Server Documentation](docs/remote-server.md) for full details on remote server configuration, toolsets, headers, and advanced usage. This file provides comprehensive instructions and examples for connecting, customizing, and installing the remote GitHub MCP Server in VS Code and other MCP hosts.\n\nWhen no toolsets are specified, [default toolsets](#default-toolset) are used.\n\n#### GitHub Enterprise\n\n##### GitHub Enterprise Cloud with data residency (ghe.com)\n\nGitHub Enterprise Cloud can also make use of the remote server.\n\nExample for `https://octocorp.ghe.com` with GitHub PAT token:\n```\n{\n    ...\n    \"proxima-github\": {\n      \"type\": \"http\",\n      \"url\": \"https://copilot-api.octocorp.ghe.com/mcp\",\n      \"headers\": {\n        \"Authorization\": \"Bearer ${input:github_mcp_pat}\"\n      }\n    },\n    ...\n}\n```\n\n> **Note:** When using OAuth with GitHub Enterprise with VS Code and GitHub Copilot, you also need to configure your VS Code settings to point to your GitHub Enterprise instance - see [Authenticate from VS Code](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/how-tos/configure-personal-settings/authenticate-to-ghecom)\n\n##### GitHub Enterprise Server\n\nGitHub Enterprise Server does not support remote server hosting. Please refer to [GitHub Enterprise Server and Enterprise Cloud with data residency (ghe.com)](#github-enterprise-server-and-enterprise-cloud-with-data-residency-ghecom) from the local server configuration.\n\n---\n\n## Local GitHub MCP Server\n\n[![Install with Docker in VS Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code-Install_Server-0098FF?style=flat-square&logo=visualstudiocode&logoColor=white)](https://insiders.vscode.dev/redirect/mcp/install?name=github&inputs=%5B%7B%22id%22%3A%22github_token%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22promptString%22%2C%22description%22%3A%22GitHub%20Personal%20Access%20Token%22%2C%22password%22%3Atrue%7D%5D&config=%7B%22command%22%3A%22docker%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22run%22%2C%22-i%22%2C%22--rm%22%2C%22-e%22%2C%22GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN%22%2C%22ghcr.io%2Fgithub%2Fgithub-mcp-server%22%5D%2C%22env%22%3A%7B%22GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN%22%3A%22%24%7Binput%3Agithub_token%7D%22%7D%7D) [![Install with Docker in VS Code Insiders](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code_Insiders-Install_Server-24bfa5?style=flat-square&logo=visualstudiocode&logoColor=white)](https://insiders.vscode.dev/redirect/mcp/install?name=github&inputs=%5B%7B%22id%22%3A%22github_token%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22promptString%22%2C%22description%22%3A%22GitHub%20Personal%20Access%20Token%22%2C%22password%22%3Atrue%7D%5D&config=%7B%22command%22%3A%22docker%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22run%22%2C%22-i%22%2C%22--rm%22%2C%22-e%22%2C%22GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN%22%2C%22ghcr.io%2Fgithub%2Fgithub-mcp-server%22%5D%2C%22env%22%3A%7B%22GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN%22%3A%22%24%7Binput%3Agithub_token%7D%22%7D%7D&quality=insiders)\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n1. To run the server in a container, you will need to have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed.\n2. Once Docker is installed, you will also need to ensure Docker is running. The Docker image is available at `ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server`. The image is public; if you get errors on pull, you may have an expired token and need to `docker logout ghcr.io`.\n3. Lastly you will need to [Create a GitHub Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new).\nThe MCP server can use many of the GitHub APIs, so enable the permissions that you feel comfortable granting your AI tools (to learn more about access tokens, please check out the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens)).\n\n<details><summary><b>Handling PATs Securely</b></summary>\n\n### Environment Variables (Recommended)\nTo keep your GitHub PAT secure and reusable across different MCP hosts:\n\n1. **Store your PAT in environment variables**\n   ```bash\n   export GITHUB_PAT=your_token_here\n   ```\n   Or create a `.env` file:\n   ```env\n   GITHUB_PAT=your_token_here\n   ```\n\n2. **Protect your `.env` file**\n   ```bash\n   # Add to .gitignore to prevent accidental commits\n   echo \".env\" >> .gitignore\n   ```\n\n3. **Reference the token in configurations**\n   ```bash\n   # CLI usage\n   claude mcp update github -e GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=$GITHUB_PAT\n\n   # In config files (where supported)\n   \"env\": {\n     \"GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN\": \"$GITHUB_PAT\"\n   }\n   ```\n\n> **Note**: Environment variable support varies by host app and IDE. Some applications (like Windsurf) require hardcoded tokens in config files.\n\n### Token Security Best Practices\n\n- **Minimum scopes**: Only grant necessary permissions\n  - `repo` - Repository operations\n  - `read:packages` - Docker image access\n  - `read:org` - Organization team access\n- **Separate tokens**: Use different PATs for different projects/environments\n- **Regular rotation**: Update tokens periodically\n- **Never commit**: Keep tokens out of version control\n- **File permissions**: Restrict access to config files containing tokens\n  ```bash\n  chmod 600 ~/.your-app/config.json\n  ```\n\n</details>\n\n### GitHub Enterprise Server and Enterprise Cloud with data residency (ghe.com)\n\nThe flag `--gh-host` and the environment variable `GITHUB_HOST` can be used to set\nthe hostname for GitHub Enterprise Server or GitHub Enterprise Cloud with data residency.\n\n- For GitHub Enterprise Server, prefix the hostname with the `https://` URI scheme, as it otherwise defaults to `http://`, which GitHub Enterprise Server does not support.\n- For GitHub Enterprise Cloud with data residency, use `https://YOURSUBDOMAIN.ghe.com` as the hostname.\n``` json\n\"github\": {\n    \"command\": \"docker\",\n    \"args\": [\n    \"run\",\n    \"-i\",\n    \"--rm\",\n    \"-e\",\n    \"GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN\",\n    \"-e\",\n    \"GITHUB_HOST\",\n    \"ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server\"\n    ],\n    \"env\": {\n        \"GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN\": \"${input:github_token}\",\n        \"GITHUB_HOST\": \"https://<your GHES or ghe.com domain name>\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Installation\n\n### Install in GitHub Copilot on VS Code\n\nFor quick installation, use one of the one-click install buttons above. Once you complete that flow, toggle Agent mode (located by the Copilot Chat text input) and the server will start.\n\nMore about using MCP server tools in VS Code's [agent mode documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers).\n\nInstall in GitHub Copilot on other IDEs (JetBrains, Visual Studio, Eclipse, etc.)\n\nAdd the following JSON block to your IDE's MCP settings.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcp\": {\n    \"inputs\": [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"promptString\",\n        \"id\": \"github_token\",\n        \"description\": \"GitHub Personal Access Token\",\n        \"password\": true\n      }\n    ],\n    \"servers\": {\n      \"github\": {\n        \"command\": \"docker\",\n        \"args\": [\n          \"run\",\n          \"-i\",\n          \"--rm\",\n          \"-e\",\n          \"GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN\",\n          \"ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server\"\n        ],\n        \"env\": {\n          \"GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN\": \"${input:github_token}\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nOptionally, you can add a similar example (i.e. without the mcp key) to a file called `.vscode/mcp.json` in your workspace. This will allow you to share the configuration with other host applications that accept the same format.\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>Example JSON block without the MCP key included</b></summary>\n<br>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"inputs\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"promptString\",\n      \"id\": \"github_token\",\n      \"description\": \"GitHub Personal Access Token\",\n      \"password\": true\n    }\n  ],\n  \"servers\": {\n    \"github\": {\n      \"command\": \"docker\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"run\",\n        \"-i\",\n        \"--rm\",\n        \"-e\",\n        \"GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN\",\n        \"ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server\"\n      ],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN\": \"${input:github_token}\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n</details>\n\n### Install in Other MCP Hosts\n\nFor other MCP host applications, please refer to our installation guides:\n\n- **[GitHub Copilot in other IDEs](/docs/installation-guides/install-other-copilot-ides.md)** - Installation for JetBrains, Visual Studio, Eclipse, and Xcode with GitHub Copilot\n- **[Claude Code & Claude Desktop](docs/installation-guides/install-claude.md)** - Installation guide for Claude Code and Claude Desktop\n- **[Cursor](docs/installation-guides/install-cursor.md)** - Installation guide for Cursor IDE\n- **[Google Gemini CLI](docs/installation-guides/install-gemini-cli.md)** - Installation guide for Google Gemini CLI\n- **[Windsurf](docs/installation-guides/install-windsurf.md)** - Installation guide for Windsurf IDE\n\nFor a complete overview of all installation options, see our **[Installation Guides Index](docs/installation-guides)**.\n\n> **Note:** Any host application that supports local MCP servers should be able to access the local GitHub MCP server. However, the specific configuration process, syntax and stability of the integration will vary by host application. While many may follow a similar format to the examples above, this is not guaranteed. Please refer to your host application's documentation for the correct MCP configuration syntax and setup process.\n\n### Build from source\n\nIf you don't have Docker, you can use `go build` to build the binary in the\n`cmd/github-mcp-server` directory, and use the `github-mcp-server stdio` command with the `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable set to your token. To specify the output location of the build, use the `-o` flag. You should configure your server to use the built executable as its `command`. For example:\n\n```JSON\n{\n  \"mcp\": {\n    \"servers\": {\n      \"github\": {\n        \"command\": \"/path/to/github-mcp-server\",\n        \"args\": [\"stdio\"],\n        \"env\": {\n          \"GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN\": \"<YOUR_TOKEN>\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Tool Configuration\n\nThe GitHub MCP Server supports enabling or disabling specific groups of functionalities via the `--toolsets` flag. This allows you to control which GitHub API capabilities are available to your AI tools. Enabling only the toolsets that you need can help the LLM with tool choice and reduce the context size.\n\n_Toolsets are not limited to Tools. Relevant MCP Resources and Prompts are also included where applicable._\n\nWhen no toolsets are specified, [default toolsets](#default-toolset) are used.\n\n> **Looking for examples?** See the [Server Configuration Guide](./docs/server-configuration.md) for common recipes like minimal setups, read-only mode, and combining tools with toolsets.\n\n#### Specifying Toolsets\n\nTo specify toolsets you want available to the LLM, you can pass an allow-list in two ways:\n\n1. **Using Command Line Argument**:\n\n   ```bash\n   github-mcp-server --toolsets repos,issues,pull_requests,actions,code_security\n   ```\n\n2. **Using Environment Variable**:\n   ```bash\n   GITHUB_TOOLSETS=\"repos,issues,pull_requests,actions,code_security\" ./github-mcp-server\n   ```\n\nThe environment variable `GITHUB_TOOLSETS` takes precedence over the command line argument if both are provided.\n\n#### Specifying Individual Tools\n\nYou can also configure specific tools using the `--tools` flag. Tools can be used independently or combined with toolsets and dynamic toolsets discovery for fine-grained control.\n\n1. **Using Command Line Argument**:\n\n   ```bash\n   github-mcp-server --tools get_file_contents,issue_read,create_pull_request\n   ```\n\n2. **Using Environment Variable**:\n   ```bash\n   GITHUB_TOOLS=\"get_file_contents,issue_read,create_pull_request\" ./github-mcp-server\n   ```\n\n3. **Combining with Toolsets** (additive):\n   ```bash\n   github-mcp-server --toolsets repos,issues --tools get_gist\n   ```\n   This registers all tools from `repos` and `issues` toolsets, plus `get_gist`.\n\n4. **Combining with Dynamic Toolsets** (additive):\n   ```bash\n   github-mcp-server --tools get_file_contents --dynamic-toolsets\n   ```\n   This registers `get_file_contents` plus the dynamic toolset tools (`enable_toolset`, `list_available_toolsets`, `get_toolset_tools`).\n\n**Important Notes:**\n- Tools, toolsets, and dynamic toolsets can all be used together\n- Read-only mode takes priority: write tools are skipped if `--read-only` is set, even if explicitly requested via `--tools`\n- Tool names must match exactly (e.g., `get_file_contents`, not `getFileContents`). Invalid tool names will cause the server to fail at startup with an error message\n- When tools are renamed, old names are preserved as aliases for backward compatibility. See [Deprecated Tool Aliases](docs/deprecated-tool-aliases.md) for details.\n\n### Using Toolsets With Docker\n\nWhen using Docker, you can pass the toolsets as environment variables:\n\n```bash\ndocker run -i --rm \\\n  -e GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your-token> \\\n  -e GITHUB_TOOLSETS=\"repos,issues,pull_requests,actions,code_security\" \\\n  ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server\n```\n\n### Using Tools With Docker\n\nWhen using Docker, you can pass specific tools as environment variables. You can also combine tools with toolsets:\n\n```bash\n# Tools only\ndocker run -i --rm \\\n  -e GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your-token> \\\n  -e GITHUB_TOOLS=\"get_file_contents,issue_read,create_pull_request\" \\\n  ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server\n\n# Tools combined with toolsets (additive)\ndocker run -i --rm \\\n  -e GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your-token> \\\n  -e GITHUB_TOOLSETS=\"repos,issues\" \\\n  -e GITHUB_TOOLS=\"get_gist\" \\\n  ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server\n```\n\n### Special toolsets\n\n#### \"all\" toolset\n\nThe special toolset `all` can be provided to enable all available toolsets regardless of any other configuration:\n\n```bash\n./github-mcp-server --toolsets all\n```\n\nOr using the environment variable:\n\n```bash\nGITHUB_TOOLSETS=\"all\" ./github-mcp-server\n```\n\n#### \"default\" toolset\nThe default toolset `default` is the configuration that gets passed to the server if no toolsets are specified.\n\nThe default configuration is:\n- context\n- repos\n- issues\n- pull_requests\n- users\n\nTo keep the default configuration and add additional toolsets:\n\n```bash\nGITHUB_TOOLSETS=\"default,stargazers\" ./github-mcp-server\n```\n\n### Available Toolsets\n\nThe following sets of tools are available:\n\n<!-- START AUTOMATED TOOLSETS -->\n|

Please test it out and let us know if you encounter any issues.\n\nInstead of starting with all tools enabled, you can turn on dynamic toolset discovery. Dynamic toolsets allow the MCP host to list and enable toolsets in response to a user prompt. This should help to avoid situations where the model gets confused by the sheer number of tools available.\n\n### Using Dynamic Tool Discovery\n\nWhen using the binary, you can pass the `--dynamic-toolsets` flag.\n\n```bash\n./github-mcp-server --dynamic-toolsets\n```\n\nWhen using Docker, you can pass the toolsets as environment variables:\n\n```bash\ndocker run -i --rm \\\n  -e GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your-token> \\\n  -e GITHUB_DYNAMIC_TOOLSETS=1 \\\n  ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server\n```\n\n## Read-Only Mode\n\nTo run the server in read-only mode, you can use the `--read-only` flag. This will only offer read-only tools, preventing any modifications to repositories, issues, pull requests, etc.\n\n```bash\n./github-mcp-server --read-only\n```\n\nWhen using Docker, you can pass the read-only mode as an environment variable:\n\n```bash\ndocker run -i --rm \\\n  -e GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your-token> \\\n  -e GITHUB_READ_ONLY=1 \\\n  ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server\n```\n\n## Lockdown Mode\n\nLockdown mode limits the content that the server will surface from public repositories. When enabled, the server checks whether the author of each item has push access to the repository. Private repositories are unaffected, and collaborators keep full access to their own content.\n\n```bash\n./github-mcp-server --lockdown-mode\n```\n\nWhen running with Docker, set the corresponding environment variable:\n\n```bash\ndocker run -i --rm \\\n  -e GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your-token> \\\n  -e GITHUB_LOCKDOWN_MODE=1 \\\n  ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server\n```\n\nThe behavior of lockdown mode depends on the tool invoked.\n\nFollowing tools will return an error when the author lacks the push access:\n\n- `issue_read:get`\n- `pull_request_read:get`\n\nFollowing tools will filter out content from users lacking the push access:\n\n- `issue_read:get_comments`\n- `issue_read:get_sub_issues`\n- `pull_request_read:get_comments`\n- `pull_request_read:get_review_comments`\n- `pull_request_read:get_reviews`\n\n## i18n / Overriding Descriptions\n\nThe descriptions of the tools can be overridden by creating a\n`github-mcp-server-config.json` file in the same directory as the binary.\n\nThe file should contain a JSON object with the tool names as keys and the new\ndescriptions as values. For example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"TOOL_ADD_ISSUE_COMMENT_DESCRIPTION\": \"an alternative description\",\n  \"TOOL_CREATE_BRANCH_DESCRIPTION\": \"Create a new branch in a GitHub repository\"\n}\n```\n\nYou can create an export of the current translations by running the binary with\nthe `--export-translations` flag.\n\nThis flag will preserve any translations/overrides you have made, while adding\nany new translations that have been added to the binary since the last time you\nexported.\n\n```sh\n./github-mcp-server --export-translations\ncat github-mcp-server-config.json\n```\n\nYou can also use ENV vars to override the descriptions. The environment\nvariable names are the same as the keys in the JSON file, prefixed with\n`GITHUB_MCP_` and all uppercase.\n\nFor example, to override the `TOOL_ADD_ISSUE_COMMENT_DESCRIPTION` tool, you can\nset the following environment variable:\n\n```sh\nexport GITHUB_MCP_TOOL_ADD_ISSUE_COMMENT_DESCRIPTION=\"an alternative description\"\n```\n\n## Library Usage\n\nThe exported Go API of this module should currently be considered unstable, and subject to breaking changes. In the future, we may offer stability; please file an issue if there is a use case where this would be valuable.\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under the terms of the MIT open source license.
