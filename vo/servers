If you are the maintainer of a plugin, or custom DocumentConverter, you likely need to update your code. Otherwise, if only using the MarkItDown class or CLI (as in these examples), you should not need to change anything.\n\nMarkItDown is a lightweight Python utility for converting various files to Markdown for use with LLMs and related text analysis pipelines. To this end, it is most comparable to [textract](https://github.com/deanmalmgren/textract), but with a focus on preserving important document structure and content as Markdown (including: headings, lists, tables, links, etc.) While the output is often reasonably presentable and human-friendly, it is meant to be consumed by text analysis tools -- and may not be the best option for high-fidelity document conversions for human consumption.\n\nMarkItDown currently supports the conversion from:\n\n- PDF\n- PowerPoint\n- Word\n- Excel\n- Images (EXIF metadata and OCR)\n- Audio (EXIF metadata and speech transcription)\n- HTML\n- Text-based formats (CSV, JSON, XML)\n- ZIP files (iterates over contents)\n- Youtube URLs\n- EPubs\n- ... and more!\n\n## Why Markdown?\n\nMarkdown is extremely close to plain text, with minimal markup or formatting, but still\nprovides a way to represent important document structure. Mainstream LLMs, such as\nOpenAI's GPT-4o, natively \"_speak_\" Markdown, and often incorporate Markdown into their\nresponses unprompted. This suggests that they have been trained on vast amounts of\nMarkdown-formatted text, and understand it well. As a side benefit, Markdown conventions\nare also highly token-efficient.\n\n## Prerequisites\nMarkItDown requires Python 3.10 or higher. It is recommended to use a virtual environment to avoid dependency conflicts.\n\nWith the standard Python installation, you can create and activate a virtual environment using the following commands:\n\n```bash\npython -m venv .venv\nsource .venv/bin/activate\n```\n\nIf using `uv`, you can create a virtual environment with:\n\n```bash\nuv venv --python=3.12 .venv\nsource .venv/bin/activate\n# NOTE: Be sure to use 'uv pip install' rather than just 'pip install' to install packages in this virtual environment\n```\n\nIf you are using Anaconda, you can create a virtual environment with:\n\n```bash\nconda create -n markitdown python=3.12\nconda activate markitdown\n```\n\n## Installation\n\nTo install MarkItDown, use pip: `pip install 'markitdown[all]'`. Alternatively, you can install it from the source:\n\n```bash\ngit clone git@github.com:microsoft/markitdown.git\ncd markitdown\npip install -e 'packages/markitdown[all]'\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n### Command-Line\n\n```bash\nmarkitdown path-to-file.pdf > document.md\n```\n\nOr use `-o` to specify the output file:\n\n```bash\nmarkitdown path-to-file.pdf -o document.md\n```\n\nYou can also pipe content:\n\n```bash\ncat path-to-file.pdf | markitdown\n```\n\n### Optional Dependencies\nMarkItDown has optional dependencies for activating various file formats. Earlier in this document, we installed all optional dependencies with the `[all]` option. However, you can also install them individually for more control. For example:\n\n```bash\npip install 'markitdown[pdf, docx, pptx]'\n```\n\nwill install only the dependencies for PDF, DOCX, and PPTX files.\n\nAt the moment, the following optional dependencies are available:\n\n* `[all]` Installs all optional dependencies\n* `[pptx]` Installs dependencies for PowerPoint files\n* `[docx]` Installs dependencies for Word files\n* `[xlsx]` Installs dependencies for Excel files\n* `[xls]` Installs dependencies for older Excel files\n* `[pdf]` Installs dependencies for PDF files\n* `[outlook]` Installs dependencies for Outlook messages\n* `[az-doc-intel]` Installs dependencies for Azure Document Intelligence\n* `[audio-transcription]` Installs dependencies for audio transcription of wav and mp3 files\n* `[youtube-transcription]` Installs dependencies for fetching YouTube video transcription\n\n### Plugins\n\nMarkItDown also supports 3rd-party plugins. Plugins are disabled by default. To list installed plugins:\n\n```bash\nmarkitdown --list-plugins\n```\n\nTo enable plugins use:\n\n```bash\nmarkitdown --use-plugins path-to-file.pdf\n```\n\nTo find available plugins, search GitHub for the hashtag `#markitdown-plugin`. To develop a plugin, see `packages/markitdown-sample-plugin`.\n\n### Azure Document Intelligence\n\nTo use Microsoft Document Intelligence for conversion:\n\n```bash\nmarkitdown path-to-file.pdf -o document.md -d -e \"<document_intelligence_endpoint>\"\n```\n\nMore information about how to set up an Azure Document Intelligence Resource can be found [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/document-intelligence/how-to-guides/create-document-intelligence-resource?view=doc-intel-4.0.0)\n\n### Python API\n\nBasic usage in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom markitdown import MarkItDown\n\nmd = MarkItDown(enable_plugins=False) # Set to True to enable plugins\nresult = md.convert(\"test.xlsx\")\nprint(result.text_content)\n```\n\nDocument Intelligence conversion in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom markitdown import MarkItDown\n\nmd = MarkItDown(docintel_endpoint=\"<document_intelligence_endpoint>\")\nresult = md.convert(\"test.pdf\")\nprint(result.text_content)\n```\n\nTo use Large Language Models for image descriptions (currently only for pptx and image files), provide `llm_client` and `llm_model`:\n\n```python\nfrom markitdown import MarkItDown\nfrom openai import OpenAI\n\nclient = OpenAI()\nmd = MarkItDown(llm_client=client, llm_model=\"gpt-4o\", llm_prompt=\"optional custom prompt\")\nresult = md.convert(\"example.jpg\")\nprint(result.text_content)\n```\n\n### Docker\n\n```sh\ndocker build -t markitdown:latest .\ndocker run --rm -i markitdown:latest < ~/your-file.pdf > output.md\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nThis project welcomes contributions and suggestions.

Type `/mcp` within droid to manage servers, authenticate, and view available tools.\n\n</details>\n\n## 🔨 Available Tools\n\nContext7 MCP provides the following tools that LLMs can use:\n\n- `resolve-library-id`: Resolves a general library name into a Context7-compatible library ID.\n  - `libraryName` (required): The name of the library to search for\n\n- `get-library-docs`: Fetches documentation for a library using a Context7-compatible library ID.\n  - `context7CompatibleLibraryID` (required): Exact Context7-compatible library ID (e.g., `/mongodb/docs`, `/vercel/next.js`)\n  - `topic` (optional): Focus the docs on a specific topic (e.g., \"routing\", \"hooks\")\n  - `tokens` (optional, default 5000): Max number of tokens to return. Values less than 1000 are automatically increased to 1000.\n\n## 🛟 Tips\n\n### Add a Rule\n\nIf you don’t want to add `use context7` to every prompt, you can define a simple rule in your MCP client's rule section:\n\n- For Windsurf, in `.windsurfrules` file\n- For Cursor, from `Cursor Settings > Rules` section\n- For Claude Code, in `CLAUDE.md` file\n\nOr the equivalent in your MCP client to auto-invoke Context7 on any code question.\n\n#### Example Rule\n\n```txt\nAlways use context7 when I need code generation, setup or configuration steps, or\nlibrary/API documentation. This means you should automatically use the Context7 MCP\ntools to resolve library id and get library docs without me having to explicitly ask.\n```\n\nFrom then on, you’ll get Context7’s docs in any related conversation without typing anything extra. You can alter the rule to match your use cases.\n\n### Use Library Id\n\nIf you already know exactly which library you want to use, add its Context7 ID to your prompt. That way, Context7 MCP server can skip the library-matching step and directly continue with retrieving docs.\n\n```txt\nImplement basic authentication with Supabase. use library /supabase/supabase for API and docs.\n```\n\nThe slash syntax tells the MCP tool exactly which library to load docs for.\n\n### HTTPS Proxy\n\nIf you are behind an HTTP proxy, Context7 uses the standard `https_proxy` / `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variables.\n\n## 💻 Development\n\nClone the project and install dependencies:\n\n```bash\nbun i\n```\n\nBuild:\n\n```bash\nbun run build\n```\n\nRun the server:\n\n```bash\nbun run dist/index.js\n```\n\n### CLI Arguments\n\n`context7-mcp` accepts the following CLI flags:\n\n- `--transport <stdio|http>` – Transport to use (`stdio` by default). Use `http` for remote HTTP server or `stdio` for local integration.\n- `--port <number>` – Port to listen on when using `http` transport (default `3000`).\n- `--api-key <key>` – API key for authentication (or set `CONTEXT7_API_KEY` env var). You can get your API key by creating an account at [context7.com/dashboard](https://context7.com/dashboard).\n\nExample with HTTP transport and port 8080:\n\n```bash\nbun run dist/index.js --transport http --port 8080\n```\n\nAnother example with stdio transport:\n\n```bash\nbun run dist/index.js --transport stdio --api-key YOUR_API_KEY\n```\n\n### Environment Variables\n\nYou can use the `CONTEXT7_API_KEY` environment variable instead of passing the `--api-key` flag. This is useful for:\n\n- Storing API keys securely in `.env` files\n- Integration with MCP server setups that use dotenv\n- Tools that prefer environment variable configuration\n\n**Note:** The `--api-key` CLI flag takes precedence over the environment variable when both are provided.\n\n**Example with .env file:**\n\n```bash\n# .env\nCONTEXT7_API_KEY=your_api_key_here\n```\n\n**Example MCP configuration using environment variable:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"context7\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@upstash/context7-mcp\"],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"CONTEXT7_API_KEY\": \"YOUR_API_KEY\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>Local Configuration Example</b></summary>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"context7\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"tsx\", \"/path/to/folder/context7/src/index.ts\", \"--api-key\", \"YOUR_API_KEY\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>Testing with MCP Inspector</b></summary>\n\n```bash\nnpx -y @modelcontextprotocol/inspector npx @upstash/context7-mcp\n```\n\n</details>\n\n## 🚨 Troubleshooting\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>Module Not Found Errors</b></summary>\n\nIf you encounter `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND`, try using `bunx` instead of `npx`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"context7\": {\n      \"command\": \"bunx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@upstash/context7-mcp\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis often resolves module resolution issues in environments where `npx` doesn't properly install or resolve packages.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>ESM Resolution Issues</b></summary>\n\nFor errors like `Error: Cannot find module 'uriTemplate.js'`, try the `--experimental-vm-modules` flag:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"context7\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"--node-options=--experimental-vm-modules\", \"@upstash/context7-mcp@1.0.6\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>TLS/Certificate Issues</b></summary>\n\nUse the `--experimental-fetch` flag to bypass TLS-related problems:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"context7\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"--node-options=--experimental-fetch\", \"@upstash/context7-mcp\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>General MCP Client Errors</b></summary>\n\n1.

Type `/mcp` within droid to manage servers, authenticate, and view available tools.\n\n</details>\n\n## 🔨 Available Tools\n\nContext7 MCP provides the following tools that LLMs can use:\n\n- `resolve-library-id`: Resolves a general library name into a Context7-compatible library ID.\n  - `libraryName` (required): The name of the library to search for\n\n- `get-library-docs`: Fetches documentation for a library using a Context7-compatible library ID.\n  - `context7CompatibleLibraryID` (required): Exact Context7-compatible library ID (e.g., `/mongodb/docs`, `/vercel/next.js`)\n  - `topic` (optional): Focus the docs on a specific topic (e.g., \"routing\", \"hooks\")\n  - `tokens` (optional, default 5000): Max number of tokens to return. Values less than 1000 are automatically increased to 1000.\n\n## 🛟 Tips\n\n### Add a Rule\n\nIf you don’t want to add `use context7` to every prompt, you can define a simple rule in your MCP client's rule section:\n\n- For Windsurf, in `.windsurfrules` file\n- For Cursor, from `Cursor Settings > Rules` section\n- For Claude Code, in `CLAUDE.md` file\n\nOr the equivalent in your MCP client to auto-invoke Context7 on any code question.\n\n#### Example Rule\n\n```txt\nAlways use context7 when I need code generation, setup or configuration steps, or\nlibrary/API documentation. This means you should automatically use the Context7 MCP\ntools to resolve library id and get library docs without me having to explicitly ask.\n```\n\nFrom then on, you’ll get Context7’s docs in any related conversation without typing anything extra. You can alter the rule to match your use cases.\n\n### Use Library Id\n\nIf you already know exactly which library you want to use, add its Context7 ID to your prompt. That way, Context7 MCP server can skip the library-matching step and directly continue with retrieving docs.\n\n```txt\nImplement basic authentication with Supabase. use library /supabase/supabase for API and docs.\n```\n\nThe slash syntax tells the MCP tool exactly which library to load docs for.\n\n### HTTPS Proxy\n\nIf you are behind an HTTP proxy, Context7 uses the standard `https_proxy` / `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variables.\n\n## 💻 Development\n\nClone the project and install dependencies:\n\n```bash\nbun i\n```\n\nBuild:\n\n```bash\nbun run build\n```\n\nRun the server:\n\n```bash\nbun run dist/index.js\n```\n\n### CLI Arguments\n\n`context7-mcp` accepts the following CLI flags:\n\n- `--transport <stdio|http>` – Transport to use (`stdio` by default). Use `http` for remote HTTP server or `stdio` for local integration.\n- `--port <number>` – Port to listen on when using `http` transport (default `3000`).\n- `--api-key <key>` – API key for authentication (or set `CONTEXT7_API_KEY` env var). You can get your API key by creating an account at [context7.com/dashboard](https://context7.com/dashboard).\n\nExample with HTTP transport and port 8080:\n\n```bash\nbun run dist/index.js --transport http --port 8080\n```\n\nAnother example with stdio transport:\n\n```bash\nbun run dist/index.js --transport stdio --api-key YOUR_API_KEY\n```\n\n### Environment Variables\n\nYou can use the `CONTEXT7_API_KEY` environment variable instead of passing the `--api-key` flag. This is useful for:\n\n- Storing API keys securely in `.env` files\n- Integration with MCP server setups that use dotenv\n- Tools that prefer environment variable configuration\n\n**Note:** The `--api-key` CLI flag takes precedence over the environment variable when both are provided.\n\n**Example with .env file:**\n\n```bash\n# .env\nCONTEXT7_API_KEY=your_api_key_here\n```\n\n**Example MCP configuration using environment variable:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"context7\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@upstash/context7-mcp\"],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"CONTEXT7_API_KEY\": \"YOUR_API_KEY\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>Local Configuration Example</b></summary>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"context7\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"tsx\", \"/path/to/folder/context7/src/index.ts\", \"--api-key\", \"YOUR_API_KEY\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>Testing with MCP Inspector</b></summary>\n\n```bash\nnpx -y @modelcontextprotocol/inspector npx @upstash/context7-mcp\n```\n\n</details>\n\n## 🚨 Troubleshooting\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>Module Not Found Errors</b></summary>\n\nIf you encounter `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND`, try using `bunx` instead of `npx`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"context7\": {\n      \"command\": \"bunx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@upstash/context7-mcp\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis often resolves module resolution issues in environments where `npx` doesn't properly install or resolve packages.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>ESM Resolution Issues</b></summary>\n\nFor errors like `Error: Cannot find module 'uriTemplate.js'`, try the `--experimental-vm-modules` flag:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"context7\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"--node-options=--experimental-vm-modules\", \"@upstash/context7-mcp@1.0.6\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>TLS/Certificate Issues</b></summary>\n\nUse the `--experimental-fetch` flag to bypass TLS-related problems:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"context7\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"--node-options=--experimental-fetch\", \"@upstash/context7-mcp\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>General MCP Client Errors</b></summary>\n\n1.

If your MCP host does not support remote MCP servers, don't worry! You can use the [local version of the GitHub MCP Server](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server?tab=readme-ov-file#local-github-mcp-server) instead.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n1. A compatible MCP host with remote server support (VS Code 1.101+, Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.)\n2. Any applicable [policies enabled](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server/blob/main/docs/policies-and-governance.md)\n\n### Install in VS Code\n\nFor quick installation, use one of the one-click install buttons above. Once you complete that flow, toggle Agent mode (located by the Copilot Chat text input) and the server will start. Make sure you're using [VS Code 1.101](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_101) or [later](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates) for remote MCP and OAuth support.\n\nAlternatively, to manually configure VS Code, choose the appropriate JSON block from the examples below and add it to your host configuration:\n\n<table>\n<tr><th>Using OAuth</th><th>Using a GitHub PAT</th></tr>\n<tr><th align=left colspan=2>VS Code (version 1.101 or greater)</th></tr>\n<tr valign=top>\n<td>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"servers\": {\n    \"github\": {\n      \"type\": \"http\",\n      \"url\": \"https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n</td>\n<td>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"servers\": {\n    \"github\": {\n      \"type\": \"http\",\n      \"url\": \"https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/\",\n      \"headers\": {\n        \"Authorization\": \"Bearer ${input:github_mcp_pat}\"\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  \"inputs\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"promptString\",\n      \"id\": \"github_mcp_pat\",\n      \"description\": \"GitHub Personal Access Token\",\n      \"password\": true\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n### Install in other MCP hosts\n- **[GitHub Copilot in other IDEs](/docs/installation-guides/install-other-copilot-ides.md)** - Installation for JetBrains, Visual Studio, Eclipse, and Xcode with GitHub Copilot\n- **[Claude Applications](/docs/installation-guides/install-claude.md)** - Installation guide for Claude Web, Claude Desktop and Claude Code CLI\n- **[Cursor](/docs/installation-guides/install-cursor.md)** - Installation guide for Cursor IDE\n- **[Windsurf](/docs/installation-guides/install-windsurf.md)** - Installation guide for Windsurf IDE\n\n> **Note:** Each MCP host application needs to configure a GitHub App or OAuth App to support remote access via OAuth. Any host application that supports remote MCP servers should support the remote GitHub server with PAT authentication. Configuration details and support levels vary by host. Make sure to refer to the host application's documentation for more info.\n\n### Configuration\n\n#### Toolset configuration\n\nSee [Remote Server Documentation](docs/remote-server.md) for full details on remote server configuration, toolsets, headers, and advanced usage. This file provides comprehensive instructions and examples for connecting, customizing, and installing the remote GitHub MCP Server in VS Code and other MCP hosts.\n\nWhen no toolsets are specified, [default toolsets](#default-toolset) are used.\n\n#### Enterprise Cloud with data residency (ghe.com)\n\nGitHub Enterprise Cloud can also make use of the remote server.\n\nExample for `https://octocorp.ghe.com`:\n```\n{\n    ...\n    \"proxima-github\": {\n      \"type\": \"http\",\n      \"url\": \"https://copilot-api.octocorp.ghe.com/mcp\",\n      \"headers\": {\n        \"Authorization\": \"Bearer ${input:github_mcp_pat}\"\n      }\n    },\n    ...\n}\n```\n\nGitHub Enterprise Server does not support remote server hosting. Please refer to [GitHub Enterprise Server and Enterprise Cloud with data residency (ghe.com)](#github-enterprise-server-and-enterprise-cloud-with-data-residency-ghecom) from the local server configuration.\n\n---\n\n## Local GitHub MCP Server\n\n[![Install with Docker in VS Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code-Install_Server-0098FF?style=flat-square&logo=visualstudiocode&logoColor=white)](https://insiders.vscode.dev/redirect/mcp/install?name=github&inputs=%5B%7B%22id%22%3A%22github_token%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22promptString%22%2C%22description%22%3A%22GitHub%20Personal%20Access%20Token%22%2C%22password%22%3Atrue%7D%5D&config=%7B%22command%22%3A%22docker%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22run%22%2C%22-i%22%2C%22--rm%22%2C%22-e%22%2C%22GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN%22%2C%22ghcr.io%2Fgithub%2Fgithub-mcp-server%22%5D%2C%22env%22%3A%7B%22GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN%22%3A%22%24%7Binput%3Agithub_token%7D%22%7D%7D) [![Install with Docker in VS Code Insiders](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code_Insiders-Install_Server-24bfa5?style=flat-square&logo=visualstudiocode&logoColor=white)](https://insiders.vscode.dev/redirect/mcp/install?name=github&inputs=%5B%7B%22id%22%3A%22github_token%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22promptString%22%2C%22description%22%3A%22GitHub%20Personal%20Access%20Token%22%2C%22password%22%3Atrue%7D%5D&config=%7B%22command%22%3A%22docker%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22run%22%2C%22-i%22%2C%22--rm%22%2C%22-e%22%2C%22GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN%22%2C%22ghcr.io%2Fgithub%2Fgithub-mcp-server%22%5D%2C%22env%22%3A%7B%22GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN%22%3A%22%24%7Binput%3Agithub_token%7D%22%7D%7D&quality=insiders)\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n1. To run the server in a container, you will need to have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed.\n2. Once Docker is installed, you will also need to ensure Docker is running. The image is public; if you get errors on pull, you may have an expired token and need to `docker logout ghcr.io`.\n3. Lastly you will need to [Create a GitHub Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new).\nThe MCP server can use many of the GitHub APIs, so enable the permissions that you feel comfortable granting your AI tools (to learn more about access tokens, please check out the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens)).\n\n<details><summary><b>Handling PATs Securely</b></summary>\n\n### Environment Variables (Recommended)\nTo keep your GitHub PAT secure and reusable across different MCP hosts:\n\n1. **Store your PAT in environment variables**\n   ```bash\n   export GITHUB_PAT=your_token_here\n   ```\n   Or create a `.env` file:\n   ```env\n   GITHUB_PAT=your_token_here\n   ```\n\n2. **Protect your `.env` file**\n   ```bash\n   # Add to .gitignore to prevent accidental commits\n   echo \".env\" >> .gitignore\n   ```\n\n3. **Reference the token in configurations**\n   ```bash\n   # CLI usage\n   claude mcp update github -e GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=$GITHUB_PAT\n\n   # In config files (where supported)\n   \"env\": {\n     \"GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN\": \"$GITHUB_PAT\"\n   }\n   ```\n\n> **Note**: Environment variable support varies by host app and IDE. Some applications (like Windsurf) require hardcoded tokens in config files.\n\n### Token Security Best Practices\n\n- **Minimum scopes**: Only grant necessary permissions\n  - `repo` - Repository operations\n  - `read:packages` - Docker image access\n  - `read:org` - Organization team access\n- **Separate tokens**: Use different PATs for different projects/environments\n- **Regular rotation**: Update tokens periodically\n- **Never commit**: Keep tokens out of version control\n- **File permissions**: Restrict access to config files containing tokens\n  ```bash\n  chmod 600 ~/.your-app/config.json\n  ```\n\n</details>\n\n### GitHub Enterprise Server and Enterprise Cloud with data residency (ghe.com)\n\nThe flag `--gh-host` and the environment variable `GITHUB_HOST` can be used to set\nthe hostname for GitHub Enterprise Server or GitHub Enterprise Cloud with data residency.\n\n- For GitHub Enterprise Server, prefix the hostname with the `https://` URI scheme, as it otherwise defaults to `http://`, which GitHub Enterprise Server does not support.\n- For GitHub Enterprise Cloud with data residency, use `https://YOURSUBDOMAIN.ghe.com` as the hostname.\n``` json\n\"github\": {\n    \"command\": \"docker\",\n    \"args\": [\n    \"run\",\n    \"-i\",\n    \"--rm\",\n    \"-e\",\n    \"GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN\",\n    \"-e\",\n    \"GITHUB_HOST\",\n    \"ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server\"\n    ],\n    \"env\": {\n        \"GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN\": \"${input:github_token}\",\n        \"GITHUB_HOST\": \"https://<your GHES or ghe.com domain name>\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Installation\n\n### Install in GitHub Copilot on VS Code\n\nFor quick installation, use one of the one-click install buttons above. Once you complete that flow, toggle Agent mode (located by the Copilot Chat text input) and the server will start.\n\nMore about using MCP server tools in VS Code's [agent mode documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers).\n\nInstall in GitHub Copilot on other IDEs (JetBrains, Visual Studio, Eclipse, etc.)\n\nAdd the following JSON block to your IDE's MCP settings.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcp\": {\n    \"inputs\": [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"promptString\",\n        \"id\": \"github_token\",\n        \"description\": \"GitHub Personal Access Token\",\n        \"password\": true\n      }\n    ],\n    \"servers\": {\n      \"github\": {\n        \"command\": \"docker\",\n        \"args\": [\n          \"run\",\n          \"-i\",\n          \"--rm\",\n          \"-e\",\n          \"GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN\",\n          \"ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server\"\n        ],\n        \"env\": {\n          \"GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN\": \"${input:github_token}\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nOptionally, you can add a similar example (i.e. without the mcp key) to a file called `.vscode/mcp.json` in your workspace. This will allow you to share the configuration with other host applications that accept the same format.\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>Example JSON block without the MCP key included</b></summary>\n<br>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"inputs\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"promptString\",\n      \"id\": \"github_token\",\n      \"description\": \"GitHub Personal Access Token\",\n      \"password\": true\n    }\n  ],\n  \"servers\": {\n    \"github\": {\n      \"command\": \"docker\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"run\",\n        \"-i\",\n        \"--rm\",\n        \"-e\",\n        \"GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN\",\n        \"ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server\"\n      ],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN\": \"${input:github_token}\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n</details>\n\n### Install in Other MCP Hosts\n\nFor other MCP host applications, please refer to our installation guides:\n\n- **[GitHub Copilot in other IDEs](/docs/installation-guides/install-other-copilot-ides.md)** - Installation for JetBrains, Visual Studio, Eclipse, and Xcode with GitHub Copilot\n- **[Claude Code & Claude Desktop](docs/installation-guides/install-claude.md)** - Installation guide for Claude Code and Claude Desktop\n- **[Cursor](docs/installation-guides/install-cursor.md)** - Installation guide for Cursor IDE\n- **[Google Gemini CLI](docs/installation-guides/install-gemini-cli.md)** - Installation guide for Google Gemini CLI\n- **[Windsurf](docs/installation-guides/install-windsurf.md)** - Installation guide for Windsurf IDE\n\nFor a complete overview of all installation options, see our **[Installation Guides Index](docs/installation-guides)**.\n\n> **Note:** Any host application that supports local MCP servers should be able to access the local GitHub MCP server. However, the specific configuration process, syntax and stability of the integration will vary by host application. While many may follow a similar format to the examples above, this is not guaranteed. Please refer to your host application's documentation for the correct MCP configuration syntax and setup process.\n\n### Build from source\n\nIf you don't have Docker, you can use `go build` to build the binary in the\n`cmd/github-mcp-server` directory, and use the `github-mcp-server stdio` command with the `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable set to your token. To specify the output location of the build, use the `-o` flag. You should configure your server to use the built executable as its `command`. For example:\n\n```JSON\n{\n  \"mcp\": {\n    \"servers\": {\n      \"github\": {\n        \"command\": \"/path/to/github-mcp-server\",\n        \"args\": [\"stdio\"],\n        \"env\": {\n          \"GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN\": \"<YOUR_TOKEN>\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Tool Configuration\n\nThe GitHub MCP Server supports enabling or disabling specific groups of functionalities via the `--toolsets` flag. This allows you to control which GitHub API capabilities are available to your AI tools. Enabling only the toolsets that you need can help the LLM with tool choice and reduce the context size.\n\n_Toolsets are not limited to Tools. Relevant MCP Resources and Prompts are also included where applicable._\n\nWhen no toolsets are specified, [default toolsets](#default-toolset) are used.\n\n#### Specifying Toolsets\n\nTo specify toolsets you want available to the LLM, you can pass an allow-list in two ways:\n\n1. **Using Command Line Argument**:\n\n   ```bash\n   github-mcp-server --toolsets repos,issues,pull_requests,actions,code_security\n   ```\n\n2. **Using Environment Variable**:\n   ```bash\n   GITHUB_TOOLSETS=\"repos,issues,pull_requests,actions,code_security\" ./github-mcp-server\n   ```\n\nThe environment variable `GITHUB_TOOLSETS` takes precedence over the command line argument if both are provided.\n\n### Using Toolsets With Docker\n\nWhen using Docker, you can pass the toolsets as environment variables:\n\n```bash\ndocker run -i --rm \\\n  -e GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your-token> \\\n  -e GITHUB_TOOLSETS=\"repos,issues,pull_requests,actions,code_security,experiments\" \\\n  ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server\n```\n\n### Special toolsets\n\n#### \"all\" toolset\n\nThe special toolset `all` can be provided to enable all available toolsets regardless of any other configuration:\n\n```bash\n./github-mcp-server --toolsets all\n```\n\nOr using the environment variable:\n\n```bash\nGITHUB_TOOLSETS=\"all\" ./github-mcp-server\n```\n\n#### \"default\" toolset\nThe default toolset `default` is the configuration that gets passed to the server if no toolsets are specified.\n\nThe default configuration is:\n- context\n- repos\n- issues\n- pull_requests\n- users\n\nTo keep the default configuration and add additional toolsets:\n\n```bash\nGITHUB_TOOLSETS=\"default,stargazers\" ./github-mcp-server\n```\n\n### Available Toolsets\n\nThe following sets of tools are available:\n\n<!-- START AUTOMATED TOOLSETS -->\n| Toolset                 | Description                                                   |\n| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `context`               | **Strongly recommended**: Tools that provide context about the current user and GitHub context you are operating in |\n| `actions` | GitHub Actions workflows and CI/CD operations |\n| `code_security` | Code security related tools, such as GitHub Code Scanning |\n| `dependabot` | Dependabot tools |\n| `discussions` | GitHub Discussions related tools |\n| `experiments` | Experimental features that are not considered stable yet |\n| `gists` | GitHub Gist related tools |\n| `git` | GitHub Git API related tools for low-level Git operations |\n| `issues` | GitHub Issues related tools |\n| `labels` | GitHub Labels related tools |\n| `notifications` | GitHub Notifications related tools |\n| `orgs` | GitHub Organization related tools |\n| `projects` | GitHub Projects related tools |\n| `pull_requests` | GitHub Pull Request related tools |\n| `repos` | GitHub Repository related tools |\n| `secret_protection` | Secret protection related tools, such as GitHub Secret Scanning |\n| `security_advisories` | Security advisories related tools |\n| `stargazers` | GitHub Stargazers related tools |\n| `users` | GitHub User related tools |\n<!-- END AUTOMATED TOOLSETS -->\n\n### Additional Toolsets in Remote Github MCP Server\n\n| Toolset                 | Description                                                   |\n| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `copilot` | Copilot related tools (e.g. Copilot Coding Agent) |\n| `copilot_spaces` | Copilot Spaces related tools |\n| `github_support_docs_search` | Search docs to answer GitHub product and support questions |\n\n## Tools\n\n<!-- START AUTOMATED TOOLS -->\n<details>\n\n<summary>Actions</summary>\n\n- **cancel_workflow_run** -

Please test it out and let us know if you encounter any issues.\n\nInstead of starting with all tools enabled, you can turn on dynamic toolset discovery. Dynamic toolsets allow the MCP host to list and enable toolsets in response to a user prompt. This should help to avoid situations where the model gets confused by the sheer number of tools available.\n\n### Using Dynamic Tool Discovery\n\nWhen using the binary, you can pass the `--dynamic-toolsets` flag.\n\n```bash\n./github-mcp-server --dynamic-toolsets\n```\n\nWhen using Docker, you can pass the toolsets as environment variables:\n\n```bash\ndocker run -i --rm \\\n  -e GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your-token> \\\n  -e GITHUB_DYNAMIC_TOOLSETS=1 \\\n  ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server\n```\n\n## Read-Only Mode\n\nTo run the server in read-only mode, you can use the `--read-only` flag. This will only offer read-only tools, preventing any modifications to repositories, issues, pull requests, etc.\n\n```bash\n./github-mcp-server --read-only\n```\n\nWhen using Docker, you can pass the read-only mode as an environment variable:\n\n```bash\ndocker run -i --rm \\\n  -e GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your-token> \\\n  -e GITHUB_READ_ONLY=1 \\\n  ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server\n```\n\n## Lockdown Mode\n\nLockdown mode limits the content that the server will surface from public repositories. When enabled, requests that fetch issue details will return an error if the issue was created by someone who does not have push access to the repository. Private repositories are unaffected, and collaborators can still access their own issues.\n\n```bash\n./github-mcp-server --lockdown-mode\n```\n\nWhen running with Docker, set the corresponding environment variable:\n\n```bash\ndocker run -i --rm \\\n  -e GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your-token> \\\n  -e GITHUB_LOCKDOWN_MODE=1 \\\n  ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server\n```\n\nAt the moment lockdown mode applies to the issue read toolset, but it is designed to extend to additional data surfaces over time.\n\n## i18n / Overriding Descriptions\n\nThe descriptions of the tools can be overridden by creating a\n`github-mcp-server-config.json` file in the same directory as the binary.\n\nThe file should contain a JSON object with the tool names as keys and the new\ndescriptions as values. For example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"TOOL_ADD_ISSUE_COMMENT_DESCRIPTION\": \"an alternative description\",\n  \"TOOL_CREATE_BRANCH_DESCRIPTION\": \"Create a new branch in a GitHub repository\"\n}\n```\n\nYou can create an export of the current translations by running the binary with\nthe `--export-translations` flag.\n\nThis flag will preserve any translations/overrides you have made, while adding\nany new translations that have been added to the binary since the last time you\nexported.\n\n```sh\n./github-mcp-server --export-translations\ncat github-mcp-server-config.json\n```\n\nYou can also use ENV vars to override the descriptions. The environment\nvariable names are the same as the keys in the JSON file, prefixed with\n`GITHUB_MCP_` and all uppercase.\n\nFor example, to override the `TOOL_ADD_ISSUE_COMMENT_DESCRIPTION` tool, you can\nset the following environment variable:\n\n```sh\nexport GITHUB_MCP_TOOL_ADD_ISSUE_COMMENT_DESCRIPTION=\"an alternative description\"\n```\n\n## Library Usage\n\nThe exported Go API of this module should currently be considered unstable, and subject to breaking changes. In the future, we may offer stability; please file an issue if there is a use case where this would be valuable.\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under the terms of the MIT open source license.

You can use the [local version of the GitHub MCP Server](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server?tab=readme-ov-file#local-github-mcp-server) instead.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n1. A compatible MCP host with remote server support (VS Code 1.101+, Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.)\n2. Any applicable [policies enabled](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server/blob/main/docs/policies-and-governance.md)\n\n### Install in VS Code\n\nFor quick installation, use one of the one-click install buttons above. Once you complete that flow, toggle Agent mode (located by the Copilot Chat text input) and the server will start. Make sure you're using [VS Code 1.101](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_101) or [later](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates) for remote MCP and OAuth support.\n\nAlternatively, to manually configure VS Code, choose the appropriate JSON block from the examples below and add it to your host configuration:\n\n<table>\n<tr><th>Using OAuth</th><th>Using a GitHub PAT</th></tr>\n<tr><th align=left colspan=2>VS Code (version 1.101 or greater)</th></tr>\n<tr valign=top>\n<td>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"servers\": {\n    \"github\": {\n      \"type\": \"http\",\n      \"url\": \"https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n</td>\n<td>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"servers\": {\n    \"github\": {\n      \"type\": \"http\",\n      \"url\": \"https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/\",\n      \"headers\": {\n        \"Authorization\": \"Bearer ${input:github_mcp_pat}\"\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  \"inputs\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"promptString\",\n      \"id\": \"github_mcp_pat\",\n      \"description\": \"GitHub Personal Access Token\",\n      \"password\": true\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n### Install in other MCP hosts\n- **[GitHub Copilot in other IDEs](/docs/installation-guides/install-other-copilot-ides.md)** - Installation for JetBrains, Visual Studio, Eclipse, and Xcode with GitHub Copilot\n- **[Claude Applications](/docs/installation-guides/install-claude.md)** - Installation guide for Claude Web, Claude Desktop and Claude Code CLI\n- **[Cursor](/docs/installation-guides/install-cursor.md)** - Installation guide for Cursor IDE\n- **[Windsurf](/docs/installation-guides/install-windsurf.md)** - Installation guide for Windsurf IDE\n\n> **Note:** Each MCP host application needs to configure a GitHub App or OAuth App to support remote access via OAuth. Any host application that supports remote MCP servers should support the remote GitHub server with PAT authentication. Configuration details and support levels vary by host. Make sure to refer to the host application's documentation for more info.\n\n### Configuration\n\n#### Toolset configuration\n\nSee [Remote Server Documentation](docs/remote-server.md) for full details on remote server configuration, toolsets, headers, and advanced usage. This file provides comprehensive instructions and examples for connecting, customizing, and installing the remote GitHub MCP Server in VS Code and other MCP hosts.\n\nWhen no toolsets are specified, [default toolsets](#default-toolset) are used.\n\n#### Enterprise Cloud with data residency (ghe.com)\n\nGitHub Enterprise Cloud can also make use of the remote server.\n\nExample for `https://octocorp.ghe.com`:\n```\n{\n    ...\n    \"proxima-github\": {\n      \"type\": \"http\",\n      \"url\": \"https://copilot-api.octocorp.ghe.com/mcp\",\n      \"headers\": {\n        \"Authorization\": \"Bearer ${input:github_mcp_pat}\"\n      }\n    },\n    ...\n}\n```\n\nGitHub Enterprise Server does not support remote server hosting. Please refer to [GitHub Enterprise Server and Enterprise Cloud with data residency (ghe.com)](#github-enterprise-server-and-enterprise-cloud-with-data-residency-ghecom) from the local server configuration.\n\n---\n\n## Local GitHub MCP Server\n\n[![Install with Docker in VS Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code-Install_Server-0098FF?style=flat-square&logo=visualstudiocode&logoColor=white)](https://insiders.vscode.dev/redirect/mcp/install?name=github&inputs=%5B%7B%22id%22%3A%22github_token%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22promptString%22%2C%22description%22%3A%22GitHub%20Personal%20Access%20Token%22%2C%22password%22%3Atrue%7D%5D&config=%7B%22command%22%3A%22docker%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22run%22%2C%22-i%22%2C%22--rm%22%2C%22-e%22%2C%22GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN%22%2C%22ghcr.io%2Fgithub%2Fgithub-mcp-server%22%5D%2C%22env%22%3A%7B%22GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN%22%3A%22%24%7Binput%3Agithub_token%7D%22%7D%7D) [![Install with Docker in VS Code Insiders](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code_Insiders-Install_Server-24bfa5?style=flat-square&logo=visualstudiocode&logoColor=white)](https://insiders.vscode.dev/redirect/mcp/install?name=github&inputs=%5B%7B%22id%22%3A%22github_token%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22promptString%22%2C%22description%22%3A%22GitHub%20Personal%20Access%20Token%22%2C%22password%22%3Atrue%7D%5D&config=%7B%22command%22%3A%22docker%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22run%22%2C%22-i%22%2C%22--rm%22%2C%22-e%22%2C%22GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN%22%2C%22ghcr.io%2Fgithub%2Fgithub-mcp-server%22%5D%2C%22env%22%3A%7B%22GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN%22%3A%22%24%7Binput%3Agithub_token%7D%22%7D%7D&quality=insiders)\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n1. To run the server in a container, you will need to have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed.\n2. Once Docker is installed, you will also need to ensure Docker is running. The image is public; if you get errors on pull, you may have an expired token and need to `docker logout ghcr.io`.\n3. Lastly you will need to [Create a GitHub Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new).\nThe MCP server can use many of the GitHub APIs, so enable the permissions that you feel comfortable granting your AI tools (to learn more about access tokens, please check out the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens)).\n\n<details><summary><b>Handling PATs Securely</b></summary>\n\n### Environment Variables (Recommended)\nTo keep your GitHub PAT secure and reusable across different MCP hosts:\n\n1. **Store your PAT in environment variables**\n   ```bash\n   export GITHUB_PAT=your_token_here\n   ```\n   Or create a `.env` file:\n   ```env\n   GITHUB_PAT=your_token_here\n   ```\n\n2. **Protect your `.env` file**\n   ```bash\n   # Add to .gitignore to prevent accidental commits\n   echo \".env\" >> .gitignore\n   ```\n\n3. **Reference the token in configurations**\n   ```bash\n   # CLI usage\n   claude mcp update github -e GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=$GITHUB_PAT\n\n   # In config files (where supported)\n   \"env\": {\n     \"GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN\": \"$GITHUB_PAT\"\n   }\n   ```\n\n> **Note**: Environment variable support varies by host app and IDE. Some applications (like Windsurf) require hardcoded tokens in config files.\n\n### Token Security Best Practices\n\n- **Minimum scopes**: Only grant necessary permissions\n  - `repo` - Repository operations\n  - `read:packages` - Docker image access\n  - `read:org` - Organization team access\n- **Separate tokens**: Use different PATs for different projects/environments\n- **Regular rotation**: Update tokens periodically\n- **Never commit**: Keep tokens out of version control\n- **File permissions**: Restrict access to config files containing tokens\n  ```bash\n  chmod 600 ~/.your-app/config.json\n  ```\n\n</details>\n\n### GitHub Enterprise Server and Enterprise Cloud with data residency (ghe.com)\n\nThe flag `--gh-host` and the environment variable `GITHUB_HOST` can be used to set\nthe hostname for GitHub Enterprise Server or GitHub Enterprise Cloud with data residency.\n\n- For GitHub Enterprise Server, prefix the hostname with the `https://` URI scheme, as it otherwise defaults to `http://`, which GitHub Enterprise Server does not support.\n- For GitHub Enterprise Cloud with data residency, use `https://YOURSUBDOMAIN.ghe.com` as the hostname.\n``` json\n\"github\": {\n    \"command\": \"docker\",\n    \"args\": [\n    \"run\",\n    \"-i\",\n    \"--rm\",\n    \"-e\",\n    \"GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN\",\n    \"-e\",\n    \"GITHUB_HOST\",\n    \"ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server\"\n    ],\n    \"env\": {\n        \"GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN\": \"${input:github_token}\",\n        \"GITHUB_HOST\": \"https://<your GHES or ghe.com domain name>\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Installation\n\n### Install in GitHub Copilot on VS Code\n\nFor quick installation, use one of the one-click install buttons above. Once you complete that flow, toggle Agent mode (located by the Copilot Chat text input) and the server will start.\n\nMore about using MCP server tools in VS Code's [agent mode documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers).\n\nInstall in GitHub Copilot on other IDEs (JetBrains, Visual Studio, Eclipse, etc.)\n\nAdd the following JSON block to your IDE's MCP settings.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcp\": {\n    \"inputs\": [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"promptString\",\n        \"id\": \"github_token\",\n        \"description\": \"GitHub Personal Access Token\",\n        \"password\": true\n      }\n    ],\n    \"servers\": {\n      \"github\": {\n        \"command\": \"docker\",\n        \"args\": [\n          \"run\",\n          \"-i\",\n          \"--rm\",\n          \"-e\",\n          \"GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN\",\n          \"ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server\"\n        ],\n        \"env\": {\n          \"GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN\": \"${input:github_token}\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nOptionally, you can add a similar example (i.e. without the mcp key) to a file called `.vscode/mcp.json` in your workspace. This will allow you to share the configuration with other host applications that accept the same format.\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>Example JSON block without the MCP key included</b></summary>\n<br>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"inputs\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"promptString\",\n      \"id\": \"github_token\",\n      \"description\": \"GitHub Personal Access Token\",\n      \"password\": true\n    }\n  ],\n  \"servers\": {\n    \"github\": {\n      \"command\": \"docker\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"run\",\n        \"-i\",\n        \"--rm\",\n        \"-e\",\n        \"GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN\",\n        \"ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server\"\n      ],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN\": \"${input:github_token}\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n</details>\n\n### Install in Other MCP Hosts\n\nFor other MCP host applications, please refer to our installation guides:\n\n- **[GitHub Copilot in other IDEs](/docs/installation-guides/install-other-copilot-ides.md)** - Installation for JetBrains, Visual Studio, Eclipse, and Xcode with GitHub Copilot\n- **[Claude Code & Claude Desktop](docs/installation-guides/install-claude.md)** - Installation guide for Claude Code and Claude Desktop\n- **[Cursor](docs/installation-guides/install-cursor.md)** - Installation guide for Cursor IDE\n- **[Google Gemini CLI](docs/installation-guides/install-gemini-cli.md)** - Installation guide for Google Gemini CLI\n- **[Windsurf](docs/installation-guides/install-windsurf.md)** - Installation guide for Windsurf IDE\n\nFor a complete overview of all installation options, see our **[Installation Guides Index](docs/installation-guides)**.\n\n> **Note:** Any host application that supports local MCP servers should be able to access the local GitHub MCP server. However, the specific configuration process, syntax and stability of the integration will vary by host application. While many may follow a similar format to the examples above, this is not guaranteed. Please refer to your host application's documentation for the correct MCP configuration syntax and setup process.\n\n### Build from source\n\nIf you don't have Docker, you can use `go build` to build the binary in the\n`cmd/github-mcp-server` directory, and use the `github-mcp-server stdio` command with the `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable set to your token. To specify the output location of the build, use the `-o` flag. You should configure your server to use the built executable as its `command`. For example:\n\n```JSON\n{\n  \"mcp\": {\n    \"servers\": {\n      \"github\": {\n        \"command\": \"/path/to/github-mcp-server\",\n        \"args\": [\"stdio\"],\n        \"env\": {\n          \"GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN\": \"<YOUR_TOKEN>\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Tool Configuration\n\nThe GitHub MCP Server supports enabling or disabling specific groups of functionalities via the `--toolsets` flag. This allows you to control which GitHub API capabilities are available to your AI tools. Enabling only the toolsets that you need can help the LLM with tool choice and reduce the context size.\n\n_Toolsets are not limited to Tools. Relevant MCP Resources and Prompts are also included where applicable._\n\nWhen no toolsets are specified, [default toolsets](#default-toolset) are used.\n\n#### Specifying Toolsets\n\nTo specify toolsets you want available to the LLM, you can pass an allow-list in two ways:\n\n1. **Using Command Line Argument**:\n\n   ```bash\n   github-mcp-server --toolsets repos,issues,pull_requests,actions,code_security\n   ```\n\n2. **Using Environment Variable**:\n   ```bash\n   GITHUB_TOOLSETS=\"repos,issues,pull_requests,actions,code_security\" ./github-mcp-server\n   ```\n\nThe environment variable `GITHUB_TOOLSETS` takes precedence over the command line argument if both are provided.\n\n### Using Toolsets With Docker\n\nWhen using Docker, you can pass the toolsets as environment variables:\n\n```bash\ndocker run -i --rm \\\n  -e GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your-token> \\\n  -e GITHUB_TOOLSETS=\"repos,issues,pull_requests,actions,code_security,experiments\" \\\n  ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server\n```\n\n### Special toolsets\n\n#### \"all\" toolset\n\nThe special toolset `all` can be provided to enable all available toolsets regardless of any other configuration:\n\n```bash\n./github-mcp-server --toolsets all\n```\n\nOr using the environment variable:\n\n```bash\nGITHUB_TOOLSETS=\"all\" ./github-mcp-server\n```\n\n#### \"default\" toolset\nThe default toolset `default` is the configuration that gets passed to the server if no toolsets are specified.\n\nThe default configuration is:\n- context\n- repos\n- issues\n- pull_requests\n- users\n\nTo keep the default configuration and add additional toolsets:\n\n```bash\nGITHUB_TOOLSETS=\"default,stargazers\" ./github-mcp-server\n```\n\n### Available Toolsets\n\nThe following sets of tools are available:\n\n<!-- START AUTOMATED TOOLSETS -->\n| Toolset                 | Description                                                   |\n| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `context`               | **Strongly recommended**: Tools that provide context about the current user and GitHub context you are operating in |\n| `actions` | GitHub Actions workflows and CI/CD operations |\n| `code_security` | Code security related tools, such as GitHub Code Scanning |\n| `dependabot` | Dependabot tools |\n| `discussions` | GitHub Discussions related tools |\n| `experiments` | Experimental features that are not considered stable yet |\n| `gists` | GitHub Gist related tools |\n| `git` | GitHub Git API related tools for low-level Git operations |\n| `issues` | GitHub Issues related tools |\n| `labels` | GitHub Labels related tools |\n| `notifications` | GitHub Notifications related tools |\n| `orgs` | GitHub Organization related tools |\n| `projects` | GitHub Projects related tools |\n| `pull_requests` | GitHub Pull Request related tools |\n| `repos` | GitHub Repository related tools |\n| `secret_protection` | Secret protection related tools, such as GitHub Secret Scanning |\n| `security_advisories` | Security advisories related tools |\n| `stargazers` | GitHub Stargazers related tools |\n| `users` | GitHub User related tools |\n<!-- END AUTOMATED TOOLSETS -->\n\n### Additional Toolsets in Remote Github MCP Server\n\n| Toolset                 | Description                                                   |\n| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `copilot` | Copilot related tools (e.g. Copilot Coding Agent) |\n| `copilot_spaces` | Copilot Spaces related tools |\n| `github_support_docs_search` | Search docs to answer GitHub product and support questions |\n\n## Tools\n\n<!-- START AUTOMATED TOOLS -->\n<details>\n\n<summary>Actions</summary>\n\n- **cancel_workflow_run** -

Please test it out and let us know if you encounter any issues.\n\nInstead of starting with all tools enabled, you can turn on dynamic toolset discovery. Dynamic toolsets allow the MCP host to list and enable toolsets in response to a user prompt. This should help to avoid situations where the model gets confused by the sheer number of tools available.\n\n### Using Dynamic Tool Discovery\n\nWhen using the binary, you can pass the `--dynamic-toolsets` flag.\n\n```bash\n./github-mcp-server --dynamic-toolsets\n```\n\nWhen using Docker, you can pass the toolsets as environment variables:\n\n```bash\ndocker run -i --rm \\\n  -e GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your-token> \\\n  -e GITHUB_DYNAMIC_TOOLSETS=1 \\\n  ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server\n```\n\n## Read-Only Mode\n\nTo run the server in read-only mode, you can use the `--read-only` flag. This will only offer read-only tools, preventing any modifications to repositories, issues, pull requests, etc.\n\n```bash\n./github-mcp-server --read-only\n```\n\nWhen using Docker, you can pass the read-only mode as an environment variable:\n\n```bash\ndocker run -i --rm \\\n  -e GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your-token> \\\n  -e GITHUB_READ_ONLY=1 \\\n  ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server\n```\n\n## Lockdown Mode\n\nLockdown mode limits the content that the server will surface from public repositories. When enabled, requests that fetch issue details will return an error if the issue was created by someone who does not have push access to the repository. Private repositories are unaffected, and collaborators can still access their own issues.\n\n```bash\n./github-mcp-server --lockdown-mode\n```\n\nWhen running with Docker, set the corresponding environment variable:\n\n```bash\ndocker run -i --rm \\\n  -e GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your-token> \\\n  -e GITHUB_LOCKDOWN_MODE=1 \\\n  ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server\n```\n\nAt the moment lockdown mode applies to the issue read toolset, but it is designed to extend to additional data surfaces over time.\n\n## i18n / Overriding Descriptions\n\nThe descriptions of the tools can be overridden by creating a\n`github-mcp-server-config.json` file in the same directory as the binary.\n\nThe file should contain a JSON object with the tool names as keys and the new\ndescriptions as values. For example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"TOOL_ADD_ISSUE_COMMENT_DESCRIPTION\": \"an alternative description\",\n  \"TOOL_CREATE_BRANCH_DESCRIPTION\": \"Create a new branch in a GitHub repository\"\n}\n```\n\nYou can create an export of the current translations by running the binary with\nthe `--export-translations` flag.\n\nThis flag will preserve any translations/overrides you have made, while adding\nany new translations that have been added to the binary since the last time you\nexported.\n\n```sh\n./github-mcp-server --export-translations\ncat github-mcp-server-config.json\n```\n\nYou can also use ENV vars to override the descriptions. The environment\nvariable names are the same as the keys in the JSON file, prefixed with\n`GITHUB_MCP_` and all uppercase.\n\nFor example, to override the `TOOL_ADD_ISSUE_COMMENT_DESCRIPTION` tool, you can\nset the following environment variable:\n\n```sh\nexport GITHUB_MCP_TOOL_ADD_ISSUE_COMMENT_DESCRIPTION=\"an alternative description\"\n```\n\n## Library Usage\n\nThe exported Go API of this module should currently be considered unstable, and subject to breaking changes. In the future, we may offer stability; please file an issue if there is a use case where this would be valuable.\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under the terms of the MIT open source license.
